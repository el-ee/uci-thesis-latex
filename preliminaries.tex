\acknowledgments
{
The research for this dissertation has been funded in part by the Intel Science and Technology Center for Social Computing, and a Rob Kling Memorial Fellowship. 
	
This dissertation gives but a few small glimpses into the lives of my many fieldwork participants. I am indebted to all of them for numerous insightful interviews, casual conversations, and welcoming me into their homes, workplaces, backyards, campsites, and lives.
  
In addition to my advisor, Melissa Mazmanian, and committee members Kavita Philip, Paul Dourish, and Geof Bowker, I would also like to thank Gary Olson, Judy Olson, and Bill Maurer who worked with me at UCI prior to the dissertation, and Christine Beckman who has been an invaluable collaborator in the research conducted with families and workers in southern California.

This dissertation would not have been possible without the support, encouragement, and intellectual engagements of my family, friends, and colleagues, in particular: Luke Olbrish, Sue Harmon, Lynn Dombrowski, Kate Darling, Mel Gregg, Lilly Irani, Nick Seaver, Six Silberman, Dillon Mahmoudi, Erin Goodling, Anthony Levenda, Oliver Haimson, Beth Reddy, Luke Stark, Austin Toombs, Sen Hirano, Katie Pine, Marisa Cohn, Jed Brubaker, Amy Voida, and Nancy Nersessian.
