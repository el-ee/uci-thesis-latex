@article{Williams:2014,
	Abstract = {In this article, we present and articulate the analytical lens of multisited design to illuminate transnational connections between sites of design, and aid in the translation of knowledge between designers and ethnographers. This position emerges from the authors' respective engagements in ethnographic research and design engagements with a slum community center in Bangkok, Thailand, and with ``makers'' and entrepreneurs in Shanghai and Shenzhen, China. In both cases, we found design to be a site of engagement with and interpretation of wider connections between different locales, and between local and global networks. We identify four crucial aspects of design for the purposes of this discussion: It is normative, concerned with function and the attainment of goals; it is practical, and oriented toward constraints and opportunities; it frames and defines problems concurrently with solving them; and it takes a systems approach that accounts for the broad context of the design situation. Approaching and participating in these aspects of design evolved in concert with our ethnographic fieldwork and analysis, allowing us to take design seriously without sacrificing an ethnographic commitment to nuanced description. We conclude by touching on the epistemological similarities, rather than conflicts, between ethnography and design.},

@inproceedings{Lindtner:2012a,
	Abstract = {

The diverse ways in which technologies are modified and appropriated into local contexts are an important theme in CSCW research. Today, translocal processes such as the formation of international corporations and the movement of people and ideas across nation states increasingly shape these local contexts of technology use and design. We draw from prior work on appropriation in CSCW and meld it with work from transnational studies to illustrate appropriation as a cultural phenomenon and as it unfolds in relation to emerging translocal processes. We ground our explorations in findings from ethnographic research on collaborations and exchange among IT professionals in urban China. This work makes two main contributions. First, it expands CSCW's focus on socio-technical systems by taking seriously socio-political and socio-economic processes. Second, it contributes to debates on cross-cultural and global technological development by employing transnational imagination as an analytical tool.

@article{Blomberg:2013,
	Abstract = {

In this article we focus attention on ethnography's place in CSCW by reflecting on how ethnography in the context of CSCW has contributed to our understanding of the sociality and materiality of work and by exploring how the notion of the `field site' as a construct in ethnography provides new ways of conceptualizing `work' that extends beyond the workplace. We argue that the well known challenges of drawing design implications from ethnographic research have led to useful strategies for tightly coupling ethnography and design. We also offer some thoughts on recent controversies over what constitutes useful and proper ethnographic research in the context of CSCW. Finally, we argue that as the temporal and spatial horizons of inquiry have expanded, along with new domains of collaborative activity, ethnography continues to provide invaluable perspectives.

	Abstract = {

Ethnographers have traditionally studied people in particular times and places. However, sociotechnical systems are often long-term enterprises, spanning the globe and serving vast communities. Drawing from three cases of research infrastructure development, this paper demonstrates a methodology in which the ethnographer examines scalar devices: actors' techniques and technologies for knowing and managing large-scale enterprises. Such devices are enacted in and across concrete times and places; for the ethnographer they are observable as activities of scaling. By examining the enactment of scale we can better investigate diverse kinds of size and growth within sociotechnical systems.

	Abstract = {
               Communication technologies have made it increasingly feasible for employees to stay connected to work when not in the office. Yet we have little understanding of the implications for important aspects of work and work life. This study investigates how the use of communication technologies beyond normal work hours relates to work-related attitudes and work-to-life conflict. Results found that employees with higher ambition and job involvement were more likely to use communication technologies after hours. Furthermore, use of communication technologies after hours was associated with the employee's work-to-life conflict as reported by the employee and a significant other of the employee.

	Abstract = {Technology has changed the business practices of millions of professional workers worldwide. The hardware and software that revolutionized how people worked were initially found only in the workplace and were used only during traditional 9-to-5 working hours. The typewriter stayed on the desk when its user went home, the office telephone was physically tied to its spot by a cable and computers were too heavy to be carried anywhere. Nowadays, however, the act of performing work is not limited to specific hours at a specific location. The latest incarnations of work related technology for professional employees, such as laptops, cell phones and the Blackberry, support work outside the confines of the office, at almost any time of the day or night (Towers et al., 2006).},

@article{Towers:2006,
	Abstract = {    Purpose
    -- This paper aims to investigate the shifting boundaries between two experiential categories -- home and work -- for office workers. The boundaries are both spatial and temporal, and the paper seeks to analyse how certain kinds of mobile technology are being used in such a way as to make these boundaries increasingly permeable.

    Design/methodology/approach
    -- The research involved both the collection of quantitative data using a survey tool, and the gathering of qualitative data through in‐depth interviews.

    Findings
    -- The paper finds that the mobile technology discussed enables work extension -- the ability to work outside the office, outside ``normal'' office hours. This provides flexibility with respect to the timing and location of work, and makes it easier to accommodate both work and family. But at the same time, of course, it also increases expectations: managers and colleagues alike expect staff to be almost always available to do work, which makes it easier for work to encroach on family time, and also leads to a greater workload. The ability to perform work extension is, then, a dual‐edged sword.

    Practical implications
    -- The paper provides both managers and non‐managers with insight into the effects of providing mobile technology to office workers, and suggests some mechanisms to mitigate negative effects.

    Originality/value
    -- The paper explores the impact of mobile technologies on non‐mobile office staff.},

@article{Ito:2015,
	Abstract = { AbstractBringing together popular culture studies and sociocultural learning theory, in this paper we formulate the concept of ``connected civics,'' grounded in the idea that young people today are engaging in new forms of politics that are profoundly participatory. Often working in collaboration with adult allies, they leverage digital media and emerging modes of connectivity to achieve voice and influence in public spheres. The rise of participatory politics provides new opportunities to support connected civics, which is socially engaged and embedded in young people's personal interests, affinities, and identities.We posit three supports that build consequential connections between young people's cultural affinities, their agency in the social world, and their civic engagement: 1. By constructing hybrid narratives, young people mine the cultural contexts they are embedded in and identify with for civic and political themes relevant to issues of public concern. 2. Through shared civic practices, members of affinity networks lower barriers to entry and multiply opportunities for young people to engage in civic and political action. 3. By developing cross-cutting infrastructure, young people--often with adults--institutionalize their efforts in ways that make a loosely affiliated network into something that is socially organized and self-sustaining.Drawing from a corpus of interviews and case studies of youth affinity networks at various sites across the US, this paper recasts the relationship between connected learning, cultural production, and participatory politics. },

@article{Derks:2014,
	Abstract = { This study examines the impact of work-related smartphone use on daily recovery from work-related efforts. The literature shows that work--home interference (WHI) is an important inhibitor of the recovery process. We propose that the extensive use of smartphones with its implicit request of 24/7 availability inhibits the process of engaging in activities that are required for daily recovery. A total of 80 employees (40 smartphone users, 40 controls) completed a 6-day diary questionnaire over a time period of 2 weeks. Contrary to our hypothesis, smartphone users did not experience more overall WHI than nonusers. Furthermore, four activities aimed at recovery were examined. We predicted that daily WHI would increase employees' engagement in recovery activities, but only if they did not use a smartphone. Results showed that, for the control group, WHI was positively related to psychological detachment, relaxation, mastery, and control activities, whereas smartphone users facing high WHI did not succeed in engaging in these recovery activities. This implies that being connected to work in the evening hours through smartphones has consequences for the extent to which employees succeed in undertaking recovery activities. },

	Abstract = {Mobile phone services are now universally diffused, creating the possibility of perpetual contact, regardless of time and location. Many think the impossibility of being `out of touch' leads to increased time pressure. In addition to claims that the mobile phone has led to harried leisure, others have argued that perpetual contact extends work into the home or intensifies work in other ways. In this article, these issues are explored using survey data employing some novel methodologies --- combining a questionnaire with logs of phone traffic recovered from respondents' handsets and a purpose-designed time-diary of technology use. Overall, results show that mobile phone use is not associated with more harried leisure. Fears of work intruding into home life appear to be exaggerated. However, there is some evidence that frequent use of mobiles during working hours is associated with work intensification, at least among men.},

	Abstract = {Information technology is entrenched in everyday life; yet, scholars have not firmly established whether this use blesses or vexes individuals and their families. This study analyzes longitudinal data (N = 1,367) from the Cornell Couples and Careers Study to assess whether increases in spillover explain changes in distress and family satisfaction associated with technology use. Structural equation models indicate that cell phone use over time (but not computer use) is associated with increases in negative forms of spillover (positive spillover is not significant) and is linked to increased distress and lower family satisfaction. Overall, the evidence suggests that technology use may be blurring work/family boundaries with negative consequences for working people.},

It identifies eight central mobile technology paradoxes that shape user experience and behavior, suggests possible design features that relate to the experienced paradoxes, and discusses how these features could be better managed. },

@article{Wajcman:2011,
	Abstract = {While the subject of interruptions has received considerable attention among organizational researchers, the pervasive presence of information and communication technologies has not been adequately conceptualized. Here we consider the way knowledge workers interact with these technologies. We present fine-grained data that reveal the crucial role of mediated communication in the fragmentation of the working day. These mediated interactions, which are both frequent and short, have been commonly viewed as interruptions --- as if the issue is the frequency of these single, isolated events. In contrast, we argue that knowledge workers inhabit an environment where communication technologies are ubiquitous, presenting simultaneous, multiple and ever-present calls on their attention. Such a framing employs a sociomaterial approach which reveals how contemporary knowledge work is itself a complex entanglement of social practices and the materiality of technical artefacts. Our findings show that employees engage in new work strategies as they negotiate the constant connectivity of communication media.},

	Abstract = {A recent article in Organization Studies used in its title the term `constant connectivity'. Though we commonly think of connectivity as `constant', temporal intermittency and actor agency make connectivity seldom, if ever, constant. Reflecting on studies of connectivity highlights the growing importance of recognizing and defining `states' of connectivity. Several states of connectivity are reviewed, namely: hypo-connectivity, hyper-connectivity, requisite and optimal connectivity (`flow'). As an organizational resource, understanding various states of connectivity is critical to future research. More empirical work is needed to determine how the volume of connectivity makes a difference to performance and other outcomes.},

@article{Hoffner:2015,
	Abstract = {This article explores how mobile phones function as an affective technology for young adults, by adapting the self-expansion model to understand attachment to mobile phones. In an online survey, 272 smart phone users reported on their recalled responses to loss/separation from their mobile phone (not by choice), as well as their use of the mobile phone for self-expansion. Results show that self-expansion via mobile phone was associated with greater inclusion of the mobile phone in the self-concept and greater subjective well-being. Most respondents reported negative feelings, such as loneliness/disconnection, anxiety, and boredom, when without their mobile phone, but others felt relieved to be out of touch with others. The use of the mobile phone for self-expansion was associated with more negative emotion and less positive emotion (relief) in response to loss/separation from the phone. Interpretations of the findings are discussed.},

	Annote = {We make a case for our field and our fieldsites through the use of ethnographic cases. Often told in the form of a story, the case can be an illustrative representation. It can also be an exception that draws attention to a rule. It can bring into exquisite detail a micro that is situated, like the tiniest of matryoshka dolls, within a macro. At other times it destabilizes these nested hierarchies, showing that what is big is (also) small, or that significant power resides in that which may be very hard to see. The ethnographic case can interrupt the networked connections of any cybernetic system by attending not to a whole (and not even to its capillary endpoints) but to the details of a situation that is at once expansive and immediate. Though explicitly incidental, cases distinguish themselves from other short forms of narrative by way of the expertise they invoke. Solving, learning from, or interpreting the case requires a level of engagement that presumes both knowledge and curiosity, the proficient habitus that makes improvisation possible. Interpretive expertise, in other words, transforms the extemporaneous into the routine, the anecdote into the lesson. Case closed. Or is it?},

	Abstract = {If technology is the new addiction, then multi-tasking is the new marching order. We check our email while cooking dinner, send a text while bathing the kids, and spend more time looking into electronic screens than into the eyes of our loved ones. With our never-ending to-do lists and jam-packed schedules, it's no wonder we re distracted.

But this isn t the way it has to be.

In July 2010, special education teacher and mother Rachel Macy Stafford decided enough was enough. Tired of losing track of what matters most in life, Rachel began practicing simple strategies that enabled her to momentarily let go of largely meaningless distractions and engage in meaningful soul-to-soul connections. She started a blog to chronicle her endeavors and soon saw how both external and internal distractions had been sabotaging her happiness and preventing her from bonding with the people she loves most.

Hands Free Mama is the digital society's answer to finding balance in a media-saturated, perfection-obsessed world. It doesn t mean giving up all technology forever. It doesn t mean forgoing our jobs and responsibilities. What it does mean is seizing the little moments that life offers us to engage in real and meaningful interaction. It means looking our loved ones in the eye and giving them the gift of our undivided attention, leaving the laundry till later to dance with our kids in the rain, and living a present, authentic, and intentional life despite a world full of distractions.

So join Rachel and go hands-free. Discover what happens when you choose to open your heart and your hands to the possibilities of each God-given moment.},

@article{Vries:2008,
	Annote = {Humans and technical artifacts belonged together and, as he phrased it, humans are the conductors in the world-orchestra of technical artifacts (Du Mode, p. 11). According to him a better understanding of the nature of technical artifacts could prevent people from being torn apart by fear and love for technology. 

In a way, the recent efforts to get a better understanding of technical artifacts thereby reflecting on concrete examples of technical artifacts (as promoted in the empirical turn in the philosophy of technology) can be seen as a similar attempt to move away from too general statements about technology that are not tested against real practice, and create a more balanced picture by carefully examining technology `from inside'

Ontologically speaking, for him a technical object is not a material entity, but an event, or rather a sequence of events.  At first sight this would mean that we have to be very careful in comparing his ideas with the Dual Nature approach, because in that approach the technical artifact is not a process, but a material entity. Simondon did discuss numerous examples of technical artifacts. As long as we are aware of the fact that he sees those artifacts primary as the outcomes of a process we can draw the comparison between his view on these artifacts and the Dual Nature view. [e: the view of artifacts as material entities]

In a situation of hypertely the artifact is fully dependent on its environment. It can only function at the interface of two worlds: the world of its own internal (technical) requirements and the external, social (or `geographic', in Simondon's terms) world in which it is used. To illustrate this, Simondon used the example of the engine in an electric locomotive. On the one hand, it needs to be adapted to the external world in order to obtain its energy, and on the other hand it needs to be adapted to the train that needs its output energy. This is typically the case for what Simondon called `elements'. These can only function in a larger whole (an artifact, or an `individual' in Simondon's terminology). This notion strongly reminds of what H.A. Simon wrote in 1969: according to him an artifact functions as a kind of `interface' between an `inner' environment, the substance and internal organization of the artifact, and an `outer' environment, the surrounding in which it operates36. The study of this is what Simon calls the `sciences of the artificial'

 Simondon claims also that in the case of an individual the artifact can function by itself, but there is still a certain dependency from its environment. A windmill is a fully functional device, but it needs the wind to function. The highest degree of context-independence is found in `ensembles', which are able to create their own necessary circumstances38. In any case, the artifact functions on the interface of its internal milieu (with its own conditions) and the external milieu (with its conditions).

We consider tensions between collaboration, ownership, and appropriation in relation to Mikhail Bakhtin's theory of dialogism. We analyze examples of these tensions from our own research in an after-school, design research program and relate them to findings from other research that explored using collaborative learning systems in classrooms. We apply dialogism to describe factors that contribute to students' perception of these classroom experiences as ones that do or do not foster collaboration, including the culture of the classroom, the affordances of the technologies used to mediate collaboration, and the role of multivocality in the classroom. Students are using, reusing, and appropriating media in creative ways outside of their school settings while teachers are increasingly incorporating related emerging technologies such as wikis, blogs, and chat rooms into their classrooms. By understanding the factors that contribute to dialogism, educators will be better equipped to create classroom cultures and design environments to encourage collaboration among students.

	Abstract = {

Interpretations of the concept of "affordances" in HCI are becoming increasingly diverse, extending well beyond the original Gibsonian meaning. We discuss some of the key analyses of affordances in HCI research and make three related claims. First, we argue that many current interpretations of the concept are essentially incompatible with Gibson. Second, we hold that the Gibsonian concept of affordances, conceptualized as interaction between animals and their environments, provides some important insights, but is, in the end, of limited relevance to HCI research. Third, we call for adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an alternative to Gibson's ecological psychology. We outline a view of technology affordances as possibilities for human action mediated by cultural means conceived as a relational property of a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and environment. We conclude with a discussion of prospects for future conceptual and empirical explorations of the meditational perspective in HCI research.

@article{Turner:2005a,
	Abstract = {The concept of affordance is relatively easy to define, but has proved to be remarkably difficult to engineer. This paradox has sparked numerous debates as to its true nature. The discussion presented here begins with a review of the use of the term from which emerges evidence for a two-fold classification---simple affordance and complex affordance. Simple affordance corresponds to Gibson's original formulation, while complex affordances embody such things as history and practice. In trying to account for complex affordance, two contrasting, but complementary philosophical treatments are considered. The first of these is Ilyenkov's account of significances which he claims are `ideal' phenomena. Ideal phenomena occupy are objective characteristics of things and are the product of human purposive activity. This makes them objective, but not independent (of any particular mind or perception) hence their similarity to affordances.The second perspective is Heidegger's phenomenological treatment of `familiarity' and `equipment'. As will be seen, Heidegger has argued that familiarity underpins our ability to cope in the world. A world, in turn, which itself comprises the totality of equipment. We cope by making use of equipment. Despite the different philosophical traditions both Ilyenkov and Heidegger have independently concluded that a thing is identified by its use and that use, in turn, is revealed by way of its affordances/significances. Finally, both authors---Heidegger directly and Ilyenkov indirectly---equate context and use, leading to the conclusion that affordance and context are one and the same.},

	Abstract = {Most research regarding online social networks such as Facebook, {MySpace}, Linked-In and Friendster has looked at these networks in terms of activity within the online network, such as profile management and friending behavior. In this paper we are instead focusing on offline socializing structures around an online social network (exemplified by Facebook) and how this can facilitate in-person social life for students. Because students lead nomadic lives, they find Facebook a particularly useful tool for initiating and managing social gatherings, and as they adopt mobile technologies that can access online social networks, their ad-hoc social life is further enabled. We conclude that online social networks are a powerful tool for encouraging peripheral friendships, important in particular to students. We emphasize that the use of online social networks must be viewed from a perspective of use that involves both mobile and stationary platforms and that it is important to relate online and offline social practices.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the central role of computerized code in shaping the social and geographical politics of inequality in advanced societies. The central argument is that, while such processes are necessarily multifaceted, multiscaled, complex and ambivalent, a great variety of `software-sorting' techniques is now being widely applied in efforts to try to separate privileged and marginalized groups and places across a wide range of sectors and domains. This paper's central demonstration is that the overwhelming bulk of software-sorting applications is closely associated with broader transformations from Keynesian to neoliberal service regimes. To illustrate such processes of software-sorting, the paper analyses recent research addressing three examples of software-sorting in practice. These address physical and electronic mobility systems, online geographical information systems {(GIS)}, and face-recognition closed circuit television {(CCTV)} systems covering city streets. The paper finishes by identifying theoretical, research and policy implications of the diffusion of software-sorted geographies within which computerized code continually orchestrates inequalities through technological systems embedded within urban environments.},

	Abstract = {HCI is reinventing itself. No longer only about being user-centered, it has set its sights on pastures new, embracing a much broader and far-reaching set of interests. From emotional, eco-friendly, embodied experiences to context, constructivism and culture, HCI research is changing apace: from what it looks at, the lenses it uses and what it has to offer. Part of this is as a reaction to what is happening in the world; ubiquitous technologies are proliferating and transforming how we live our lives. We are becoming more connected and more dependent on technology. The home, the cr{\`e}che, outdoors, public places and even the human body are now being experimented with as potential places to embed computational devices, even to the extent of invading previously private and taboo aspects of our lives. In this paper, I examine the diversity of lifestyle and technological transformations in our midst and outline some `difficult' questions these raise together with alternative directions for HCI research and practice.},

@article{Brown:2012,
	Abstract = { This article introduces the idea of a `pedagogy of regret' to illustrate some of the inadequacies in recent government policy initiatives which target young women's drinking practices. In the Australian context, the National Binge Drinking Campaign warned young women: `Don't turn a night out into a nightmare'. A similar British campaign advised individualized drinkers to `know their limits'. The rhetorical appeal of these campaigns hinges on the notion of regret: young women will lament the excesses of hedonistic indulgence the morning after given the inevitable consequences of risky behaviour. This paper shows the limitations of such an appeal through a `sympathetic online cultural studies' approach, which we use to explore the nexus between contemporary drinking cultures and the social networking site Facebook. Ordinary and mundane uses of Facebook -- status updates anticipating the weekend, mobile posts in the midst of intoxication, photo uploading and album dissemination the morning after -- reveal the anticipatory pleasures, everyday preparations and retrospective bonding involved in hedonistic and risky alcohol consumption. This demonstrates the fundamentally social dimensions accompanying young women's drinking. The enjoyment derived from sharing the `risky' and `regrettable' experience on Facebook is part of ongoing narratives between girls. Such pleasures, which are increasingly mediated by social networking sites, confound the notion that young women are haunted by inevitable regret and remorse. },

@article{Harrison:2011,
	Abstract = {Epistemological issues have long been debated by feminist philosophers aiming to answer the question, ``what difference does it make to take gendered points of view seriously in the construction of knowledge?'' Coming out of this history, a strand of work in feminist science studies has argued for the necessity of ``successor science:'' new forms of science based in standpoint epistemology, i.e. a recognition of the necessarily situated points of view of scientific knowledge-makers. In this paper, we argue that such a successor science has already come into being within the field of HCI, though it is perhaps not recognized as such by its practitioners.In particular, we identify a cluster of research we term the `third paradigm.' This cluster of research cuts across HCI research areas as typically organized by topic area. Instead, this research shares an underlying epistemological orientation closely aligned with standpoint epistemology, focused around an acknowledgment of the social, cultural, and physical situatedness of both users and analysts. Feminist philosophers of science argue that a logical outcome of standpoint epistemology is the need for science to reflexively grapple with the limitations of its own ways of knowing; we conclude such an outcome may also be in store for the third paradigm.},

@article{Grudin:1990,
	Abstract = {This paper examines the evolution of the focus of user interface research and development from the first production of commercial computer systemsin the 1950s through the present. The term ``user interface'' was not neededin the beginning, when most users were engineers and programmers; it may again become inappropriate when moreapplicationsarewrittenfor groups than for individuals. But there is a continuity to the outward movement of the computer's interface to its external environment, from hardware to software to increasingly higher-level cognitive capabilities and finally to social processes. As the focus shifts, the approaches to design and the skills required of practitioners changes. In this paper five foci or levels of development are identified. Most development today is positioned in the third level and considerable research is directed at the fourth. Some attention is now being given to the fifth: repositioning the interface in the work group or organization itself. Work at the different levels is not entirely independent, so establishing a comprehensive framework may enable us to position existing research and development efforts and plan future work more effectively.},

	Abstract = {As digital technologies are woven more closely into identity formation, society needs ways to keep tools flexible to many versions of self-presentation and avoid perpetuating the political status quo through conservative and apolitical designing. This paper explores one route, drawing on Queer Theory to look at resistance to computer formalisation of identity through queering. Several case studies explore how we might apply the oblique route to design of a range of technologies that help users define themselves. In particular, forgetting, obscuring, cheating and eluding are activities held up to counter computer strengths and offer a more flexible vision of interaction design for the future.},

	Abstract = {         
               This article asks methodological questions about studying infrastructure with some of the tools and perspectives of ethnography. Infrastructure is both relational and ecological---it means different things to different groups and it is part of the balance of action, tools, and the built environment, inseparable from them. It also is frequently mundane to the point of boredom, involving things such as plugs, standards, and bureaucratic forms. Some of the difficulties of studying infrastructure are how to scale up from traditional ethnographic sites, how to manage large quantities of data such as those produced by transaction logs, and how to understand the interplay of online and offline behavior. Some of the tricks of the trade involved in meeting these challenges include studying the design of infrastructure, understanding the paradoxes of infrastructure as both transparent and opaque, including invisible work in the ecological analysis, and pinpointing the epistemological status of indictors.

In this paper, we present a study of 'minimal intimate objects': low bandwidth devices for communicating intimacy for couples in long-distance relationships. We describe a user study of a software intimate object built to communicate a single bit at a time. The results from both log data and journal entries suggest that even a one-bit communication device is seen by users as a valuable and rich channel for communicating intimacy, despite the availability of wider channels of communication such as email, instant messaging, and telephone. We suggest the constrained nature of the communication affords active reinterpretation by its users, and discuss the results in the context of the study of intimacy in human-computer interaction.

	Abstract = {

For many first-year college students in their late teen years, communicating with parents provides crucial social support. When going to college involves moving away from home for the first time, students and their parents must rely on technologies to keep communication channels open. We studied the ways in which college freshmen communicate with their parents and the various communication technologies they use. Interviews with nineteen first-year students at a major United States university revealed insights into students' perspectives of their communication and relationships with parents. We found students to use a variety of tools to connect with their parents and identified some considerations they make when choosing tools. Furthermore, the use of these communication tools played a significant role in mediating students' social and emotional closeness with, and independence from, their parents. We conclude by discussing technical and social implications for social support of students and student-parent relationships.

	Abstract = {Despite the abundance of research on social networking sites, relatively little research has studied those who choose not to use such sites. This paper presents results from a questionnaire of over 400 Internet users, focusing specifically on Facebook and those users who have left the service. Results show the lack of a clear, binary distinction between use and non-use, that various practices enable diverse ways and degrees of engagement with and disengagement from Facebook. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals numerous complex and interrelated motivations and justifications, both for leaving and for maintaining some type of connection. These motivations include: privacy, data misuse, productivity, banality, addiction, and external pressures. These results not only contribute to our understanding of online sociality by examining this under-explored area, but they also build on previous work to help advance how we conceptually account for the sociological processes of non-use.},

	Abstract = {

Social computing technologies, such as social networking sites (SNSs), often privilege people who fit within expected, static categories. Thus, users embarking on major identity changes, such as gender transition, often encounter stress when using SNSs to interact with their online social networks. To address this problem and reflect on the design of SNSs and other social computing systems, we present the results of a comprehensive online survey of transgender and gender non-conforming SNS users. Our findings indicate that although Facebook can be a stressful place for gender transition due to difficulties of transition disclosure, support from one's Facebook network can help to mitigate some of this stress. We examine Facebook both as a site of stress and as a site of support. Better understanding the relationships between stress, disclosure, and support on SNSs for these particular users can inform technology design that will benefit people who struggle with navigating a wide range of major identity changes online.

	Abstract = {

Self-representation online can be difficult for those who are in life transitions that involve exploring new identity facets and changes in personal style. Many desire to tailor their online representations for different audiences. Social media site profiles and sharing settings offer varying levels of anonymity, privacy, and thus safety, but these settings are often opaque and poorly understood. To understand the complex relationship between identity, personal style and online self-representation, we examine how people explore and experiment with new styles in public and in private online settings during gender transition. We present the results of interviews with transgender people who have recently reinvented their personal style, or are planning to do so in the near future. We find that people explore new styles in online settings to craft possible or ideal future selves. When involving others, people engage intimate and unknown others, but often avoid weak ties. Our results indicate that to account for changing identities, social media sites must be designed to support finding inspiration and advice from strangers and style experimentation with close friends.

@article{Reid:2015,
	Abstract = { This paper examines how people navigate organizational pressures to embrace a professional identity that---like the ideal worker image---centers on devotion to work. My field study of a consulting firm demonstrated that although some people easily embrace this expected identity, for others, it conflicts with their experienced professional identity. I found that people cope with this conflict by straying from the expected identity while passing as having embraced it or revealing their deviance. Analyzing 115 interviews, performance evaluations, and turnover data, I trace how and why people manage their deviance differently across audiences within the organization, show the interdependence of these efforts, and illuminate consequences for how they are perceived and evaluated. In the firm I studied, although both men and women strayed, men were more likely than women to pass. Together, these findings highlight the importance of deviance and its management to people's professional identities, offer new insights regarding the ideal worker image's relationship to gender inequality, and enrich theory on passing and revealing. },

	Abstract = { This study utilized in‐depth interviewing, participant observation, and student diaries completed by participants to examine the quality of teacher--student relationships at a low‐cost private school in the townships of Ndola, Zambia. Amidst economic decline and the HIV/AIDS epidemic facing Zambia today, teachers and students developed strong relationships that differed from those found in government secondary schools and were shaped by the economic and social realities in the larger society. These caring relationships were facilitated by official school policy, deliberative spaces created for caring such as longer school hours and smaller class sizes, and strict oversight of teachers by the school administration. Teachers' efforts to provide students advice and resources related to the economic and health crises affecting their community resulted in the development of caring relationships that students noted were unique given their experiences in and exposure to government secondary schools. The findings of this study suggest that scholars of caring in the US and internationally should consider the material conditions of both students' and teachers' lives beyond the school environment in order to understand how caring relationships are structured, limited, and enabled in distinct moments by larger socioeconomic and political realities. },

	Abstract = { The era of Big Data has begun. Computer scientists, physicists, economists, mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, sociologists, and other scholars are clamoring for access to the massive quantities of information produced by and about people, things, and their interactions. Diverse groups argue about the potential benefits and costs of analyzing genetic sequences, social media interactions, health records, phone logs, government records, and other digital traces left by people. Significant questions emerge. Will large-scale search data help us create better tools, services, and public goods? Or will it usher in a new wave of privacy incursions and invasive marketing? Will data analytics help us understand online communities and political movements? Or will it be used to track protesters and suppress speech? Will it transform how we study human communication and culture, or narrow the palette of research options and alter what `research' means? Given the rise of Big Data as a socio-technical phenomenon, we argue that it is necessary to critically interrogate its assumptions and biases. In this article, we offer six provocations to spark conversations about the issues of Big Data: a cultural, technological, and scholarly phenomenon that rests on the interplay of technology, analysis, and mythology that provokes extensive utopian and dystopian rhetoric. },

It takes a developmental view, showing how the problem has been re-defined over time. It also adopts a `transdisciplinary' approach plotting the development of the problem under different disciplinary conditions. It argues that context is linked to interpretation in terms of connection and disconnection of phenomena construed as relevant or not. It also argues that context is a social construct: it has a `social life', and this life is susceptible to anthropological analysis. },

We argue that organization theory is extremely vibrant and highlight several areas where there are flourishing and generative developments -- institutional logics, categorization, networks, performance feedback, and strategy-as-practice. We also note the growing internationalization of organization theory as exemplified in the shifting demography of the Organization and Management Theory division at the Academy of Management as well as at the European Group on Organization Studies. As engaged organization theory supporters and scholars, we additionally argue for a more balanced appreciation of not only the weaknesses in the field, but also its strengths, and urge a re-engagement in more productive conversations about the important role of theory and theorizing.},

	Abstract = {In response to critiques of strategy tools as unhelpful or potentially dangerous for organizations, we suggest casting a sociological eye on how tools are actually mobilized by strategy makers. In conceptualizing strategy tools as tools-in-use, we offer a framework for examining the ways that the affordances of strategy tools and the agency of strategy makers interact to shape how and when tools are selected and applied. Further, rather than evaluating the correct or incorrect use of tools, we highlight the variety of outcomes that result, not just for organizations but also for the tools and the individuals who use them. We illustrate this framework with a vignette and propose an agenda and methodological approaches for further scholarship on the use of strategy tools. Copyright {\copyright} 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},
	Annote = {Key questions here: 

1. Strategy toosl are SPECIFIC. Examples: Porter's Five Forces, BCG Matrix, SWOT, 'real options', PIMS

2. Because tools are specific, off the shelf, branded, taught things, the first step is SELECTION related to tool AFFORDANCES

3. Our case is about hte CREATION of a non-specific, unique, tool

-- this could either be a hindrance or a contribution: maybe we call it a "localized tool" or an "improvised tool" or a ... ? and then one fo the huge things we contribute is 

4. Practice her eis about APPLICATION of the tool (our 'living under the number' section; we want to talk about the CREATION of the tool for MOST of the paper, creation is also a form of practice. 

5. However, i'm uncertain if we are operating at the same level for 'tool' here. One might say that the budgeting process is informed by a number of tools. There are many scales / layers here. "RevMAX" is a tool that is equivalent to what people are talking about here. Maybe we have a 'meta tool' .... ?

---

1. this paper uses the language of affordances

wikipedia, gibson: "He defined affordances as all "action possibilities" latent in the environment, objectively measurable and independent of the individual's ability to recognize them, but always in relation to agents and therefore dependent on their capabilities."

wikip: "In 1988, Donald Norman appropriated the term affordances in the context of human--machine interaction to refer to just those action possibilities that are readily perceivable by an actor."

"Norman later explained that this restriction in meaning of the term had been unintended, and that he would replace the term by "perceived affordance" in any future revision of the book"

2. tools are also used as rituals - more structured than improvisational / ritual of engagement - shows how the tool gets applied - mechanisms by which institutionalization happens. its the structure that embeds all these things into the organization

3. perfomrance is only one outcome, and things other than performance havien't been studied very well

--

why different outcomes

rituals instead of improvisation

	Abstract = {Background: The magnitude, consistency, and manner of association between sedentary time and outcomes independent of physical activity remain unclear.

Purpose: To quantify the association between sedentary time and hospitalizations, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer in adults independent of physical activity.

Data Sources: English-language studies in MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar databases were searched through August 2014 with hand-searching of in-text citations and no publication date limitations.

Study Selection: Studies assessing sedentary behavior in adults, adjusted for physical activity and correlated to at least 1 outcome.

Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers performed data abstraction and quality assessment, and a third reviewer resolved inconsistencies.

Data Synthesis: Forty-seven articles met our eligibility criteria. Meta-analyses were performed on outcomes for cardiovascular disease and diabetes (14 studies), cancer (14 studies), and all-cause mortality (13 studies). Prospective cohort designs were used in all but 3 studies; sedentary times were quantified using self-report in all but 1 study. Significant hazard ratio (HR) associations were found with all-cause mortality (HR, 1.240 [95% CI, 1.090 to 1.410]), cardiovascular disease mortality (HR, 1.179 [CI, 1.106 to 1.257]), cardiovascular disease incidence (HR, 1.143 [CI, 1.002 to 1.729]), cancer mortality (HR, 1.173 [CI, 1.108 to 1.242]), cancer incidence (HR, 1.130 [CI, 1.053 to 1.213]), and type 2 diabetes incidence (HR, 1.910 [CI, 1.642 to 2.222]). Hazard ratios associated with sedentary time and outcomes were generally more pronounced at lower levels of physical activity than at higher levels.

Limitation: There was marked heterogeneity in research designs and the assessment of sedentary time and physical activity.

Conclusion: Prolonged sedentary time was independently associated with deleterious health outcomes regardless of physical activity.

	Abstract = {
In an always-connected world, managing social inattention - that is, explaining the inability to interact at a particular time - can be as important as coordinating mutual availability. Inattention, particularly if repeated, can have significant relational consequences as it may be considered rude and can lead to painful social outcomes. Prior research has examined the butler lie, one strategy commonly used to manage social inattention while preserving relationships. This paper builds on that via an interview study of 47 participants that qualitatively examines perceptions of butler lies from both the senders' and receivers' perspectives. Participants see butler lies as a common and useful inattention management strategy, but these messages can have a negative effect receivers do not perceive the senders' intentions to be positive. Factors affecting the perception of intent include relationship strength and history, the stakes of the situation, and past behavior. The paper argues that inattention management should be considered a joint coordination problem characterized by a willingness to accept the pragmatic relational meaning of messages, which may differ from their literal semantic meaning. This hints at a collaborative view of deception, in which some interlocutors are aware they are being deceived and willing to accept deception.

@article{Marx:2010,
	Annote = {"Thus, in addition to the crucially important engine itself, the operation of the railroad required: (1) several kinds of ancillary equipment (rolling stock, stations, yards, bridges, tunnels, viaducts, signal systems, and a huge network of tracks); (2) a corporate business organization with a large cap- ital investment; (3) specialized forms of technical knowledge (railroad engineering, telegraphy); (4) a specially trained workforce with unique rail- roading skills, including civil and locomotive engineers, firemen, telegra- phers, brakemen, conductors---a workforce large and resourceful enough to keep the system functioning day and night, in all kinds of weather, 365 days a year; and (5) various facilitating institutional changes, such as regu- lations establishing standardized track gauges and a national system of standardized time zones." p. 568

[e: sociotechnical system is bigger infrastructurally, spatialy, organizationally, politically, historically than we usually give credit for when we conduct tiny little practice-based inquiries]

Quoting a footnote of Marx (Karl): "Technology discloses man's mode of dealing with Nature, the process of production by which he sustains his life, and thereby also lays bare the mode of formation of his social relations, and of the mental con- ceptions that flow from them." in Capital, New York, 1906; text from first american edition of the initial english translation

"In common parlance, nonetheless, when we refer to one of these com- plex systems as a technology, the material component more often than not serves as the tacit referent. But that restricted sense of the word, as in the case of the railroad, can be ambiguous and misleading. It is ambiguous be- cause the whole system, apart from the hardware, is so inclusive, so vari- ous---its boundaries so vague as to defy exact representation. This ambigu- ity evidently is what Heidegger had in mind by his paradoxical if telling assertion that ``the essence of technology is by no means anything techno- logical.''25 In advanced industrial societies, of course, most technological systems serve a predominantly economic purpose. In capitalist economies they characteristically take the form of private-sector manufacturing cor- porations, banks, or public utilities with large capital investments. It is noteworthy that the concept of technology gained currency during the ``incorporation of America,'' as Alan Trachtenberg persuasively describes the era during which ``machines became working parts of a dynamic sys- tem, and the motives for change, the source of industrial dynamism, lay not in the inanimate machine but in the economic necessities perceived by its owners.''" (p. 574-575)

"Consider, once again, automotive technology. Its defining, indispensa- ble material core was of course the internal combustion engine, plus---nat- urally---the rest of the automobile chassis. But surely the technology also includes the mechanized assembly lines, the factories, the skilled work- force, the automotive engineers, the engineering knowledge, the corporate structures including the stockholders and the huge capital investments, and the networks of dealers and repair facilities. Where, then, do we draw the boundary between the system and the rest of the society and culture? Do we include among the facets of automotive technology the road-building and maintenance systems, the trucking industry, the indispensable feeder industries---glass, rubber, steel, aluminum, plastics, etc.? What about the mines that provide the raw materials? The extended economic or societal reach of this technology is almost incalculable. As a source of jobs, indeed, it for a time accounted for a large fraction---perhaps a sixth---of the national workforce. And finally, what about the global oil industry? It is in large part an offspring of automotive technology, yet at one point it prob- ably surpassed its parent in size and wealth, not to mention its ecological costs and geopolitical influence. Estimating the ``impact'' of this technology on our society is a bit like estimating the impact of the bone structure on the human body."

By treating these inanimate objects---machines---as causal agents, we divert attention from the human (especially socioeconomic and political) relations responsible for precipi- tating this social upheaval.

	Abstract = {Finland is said to be at the forefront of information society development. However, the rhetoric has been deterministic, presenting an inevitable phenomenon to which all citizens have to adapt. There has been a tendency to ignore all social, regional and local differences. The province of North Karelia aspires to be a more citizen-oriented information society. The Joensuu Community Resource Centre (CRC) Netcaf{\'e} is a place which provides the opportunity (but not the necessity) for spontaneous involvement and participation in (the information) society. It creates space for local interpretations and views about information society and technology. The research is based on a questionnaire and interviews. When information technology is combined with the CRC's various other activities, it cannot be an independent, self-governed phenomenon. The CRC provides a context that allows a sense of proportion to develop in relation to information technology and the rhetoric of information society strategy.},

	Abstract = { Research on the Internet's role in politics has struggled to transcend technological determinism--the assumption, often inadvertent, that the technology simply imprints its own logic on social relationships. An alternative approach traces the ways, often numerous, in which an institution's participants appropriate the technology in the service of goals, strategies, and relationships that the institution has already organized. This amplification model can be applied in analyzing the Internet's role in politics. After critically surveying a list of widely held views on the matter, this article illustrates how the amplification model might be applied to concrete problems. These include the development of social networks and ways that technology is used to bind people together into a polity. },

	Abstract = {This paper questions the binary of material and immaterial labour in the information era. Instead, we propose a ``circuits of labour'' model, a holistic framework that helps connect various concepts and traditions in the study of labour and ICT (information and communication technology). Inspired by du Gay et al's ``circuit of culture'', we argue conventional frameworks need to be synthesized and updated to reflect fundamental changes and persisting issues of labor in our contemporary era, of which the iPhone is emblematic. On the one hand, our model consists of formal circuits, in which hierarchical domination is imposed by capital over the body of labour. On the other hand, it consists of informal circuits where relationships are defined communally between embodied practices and social and communicative capital. The informal and formal circuits of labour are ``short-circuited'' by survival labour and {\^O}playbour', meaning either circuit may absorb productive energy from the other. This article then uses the case of Foxconn, the world's largest electronic manufacturer that also produces iPhones, to illustrate the usefulness of the ``circuits of labour'' model. We finally discuss the broader implications and questions for future research.},
	Annote = {On the user/consumption side, the communicative capacity of the device provides new avenues for the gendered experience of care work, which now not only includes the actual provision of companionship but new social and psychological dependencies. The full extent of women's affective labour, which in the domestic sphere includes ``affect, care, love, education, socialization, communication, information, entertainment, organization, planning, coordination, logistics'' (Fortunati 2007, 144), finds new coherence through the iPhone. For working women, regardless of their position in the hierarchy of the formal circuits of labour, the iPhone annihilates prior separation between the paid and unpaid labour obligation. Spatial distinctions dissolve in a loop of competing communicative demands which Gregg (2011) describes as ``presence bleed''. The affective labour of the intimate device is a feature of work in cognitive capitalism.},

	Annote = { The domestication approach was developed in Great Britain in the late 1980s and early 1990s in a series of studies of media use in households (Silverstone et al., 1992; Silverstone, 1994). It drew its main inspiration from anthropology, consumption studies, and media studies (Haddon, 2006, 2007, 2011; Silverstone, 2006). Important points of inspiration were the insights that goods have a symbolic nature (Haddon, 2003, p. 44) and that (media) consumption is an active process, indeed a form of production, ``where any and every kind of textual engagement [draws on] personal, social and cultural resources in such a way as to leave the original, if such a thing [can] be identified, as significantly affected in use.'' (Silverstone, 2006, p. 232)

Implicit in the concept of domestication and central to the approach is a strong focus on the active role of users in appropriating media. Thus, the domestication approach challenges technological determinist positions expressed for instance by the common ``media effects'' discourse, where media (and media texts) are assumed to have more or less direct effects on its users (Haddon et al., 2005, p. 3; Silverstone, 2006, p. 230). Questioning such ``effects'' thinking, the domestication approach sees the social and the technological as mutually shaping; both the human and the technological is shaped in their interaction and are found to  be in a constant dialectic of change (Boczokowski \& Lievrouw, 2008; Silverstone, 2005, 2006). The domestication approach is not alone in challenging technological determinism (Hynes \& Richardson, 2009; Silverstone \& Haddon, 1996). Other significant and related contributions in this vein are approaches found under the umbrella term of social shaping of technology (MacKenzie \& Wajcman, 1999; Williams \& Edge, 1996); for instance the social construction of technology (Bijker, 1987) and actor-network theory (Latour, 1987)

Although many assumptions and theoretical underpinnings are common to both the social shaping and domestication approaches, and although the former appears to have been an indirect influence on the latter (Hynes \& Richardson, 2009; Silverstone, 1994, 2006), the two approaches have relatively independent histories and have often differed in their research interests (Boczokowski \& Lievrouw, 2008). Approaches in the social shaping of technology tradition have mainly been preoccupied with the social shaping in processes of invention and design of technology (Aune, 1996; Williams \& Edge, 1996), whereas the interest in domestication studies lies primarily in the social shaping that occurs through (active) consumption of media and technology by users in everyday life contexts (Silverstone, 2006).

Third, some scholars have stressed the importance of the ``double articulation'' of media technologies as material objects and as mediated content (Boczokowski \& Lievrouw, 2008; Livingstone, 2007; Silverstone, 1994). Media are physical objects but importantly are also ``portals to other worlds that open up realms of the imaginary, connecting the domestic living room---staggeringly---to the rest of the globe'' (Livingstone, 2007, p. 17). This double articulation distinguishes media technologies from all other objects and both aspects must be taken into account in their study (Boczokowski \& Lievrouw, 2008). Media are experienced as a totality of material object and symbolic content, and approaching the study of media in everyday life with this in mind may help sensitize the researcher to the significance of both dimensions. In the light of more recent media developments, Hartmann (2006) has argued that media, rather than doubly articulated, should be understood as triply articulated; as material objects, symbolic environments and individual texts. This understanding, then, further sensitizes the domestication researcher to the different levels at which media technologies are consumed.

	Abstract = {This dissertation is about China's nascent DIY (do it yourself) "maker" community, brought together through the technological and discursive productions of a collective of geeks, bloggers, new media artists, and tech entrepreneurs. It is also about creativity and examines how seemingly opposing groups such as DIY makers and Communist politicians argue that creativity is the way of the future for economic and social change in China and the world writ large. It is likewise about why creativity matters, not just to DIY makers, politicians, tech industries, and business management, but to all of us using, designing, or studying contemporary information technologies.

...

This dissertation shows that China's "remake" is accomplished through partial alignments and parasitic collaborations between seemingly opposing groups such as countercultural makers, Communist politicians, urban planners, and policy makers. It expores a series of productions by these actors such as SIY maker manifestos free and open tehnology, governmental policy, space making projects such as the set up of creative industry clusters as well as China's first hacker space and coworking spce, the open source productions at a hardware incubator in Shenzhen. To understand the wider ramifications of China's remake it is crucial to take *making* itself seriously as a nrrative of change and a mode of material and cultural production. Thsi focus on making includes studying th ways in which people re-imagine the world *and* how they in so doing also *make* worlds such as alternate spaces of work and leisure, conceptions of work and innovation and ideas of selfhood and collectivity.},

	Abstract = {

In studying technological change, we often seek to understand the dynamics of how technologies and practice shape each other over time, examining sites of innovation, adaptation, and appropriation, of making and re-making systems anew. However less attention has been given to how formerly cutting-edge technologies become old, how people work alongside aging and obsolescent systems, or how organizations prepare for the end of a technology's life cycle.

In this dissertation, I argue that this bias towards progressivist accounts of technological change obscures the lived temporal relations of systems work. 

 shift attention from understanding how technologies emerge in practice, to how people live with technological change at the duration of lived experience. I articulate a lens that reveals technological change not as a single phenomenon belonging to a totalized system (e.g., the organizational infrastructure, information ecology, or sociotechnical system) but rather as multiple modes or regimes among which people, and organizations, evaluate how technologies (ought to) develop over time.

This Pictorial takes a different look at digital cameras and photos. It frames this look within a counterfunctional design perspective. This works is presented not as a design process documentation, but rather as a type of visual-textual design artifact. We see it as a means to present new concepts composed of both the textual-theoretical and visual-designerly varieties. While cameras and photos are the ostensible thematic focus, these technologies are in turn used as a focusing device for a broader conceptual theme: designing digital limitations.

	Abstract = {Recent research efforts have led to the creation of a number of systems that provide specialised support for collaborative web search. However, the use of these tools has not been studied outside of the laboratory, and as collaborative search becomes increasingly commonplace in everyday life, there is a need to understand whether the support provided by collaborative search systems fits with real-world information seeking practices. In the present study, we deployed two collaborative search tools to pairs of searchers with genuine information needs. We report findings from in-depth interviews conducted after searchers had used their assigned system for an extended period of time. Our findings show how system features were used and appropriated in pursuit of collaboration, throwing light on the way in which collaborative search is conducted in quotidian settings. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a study of WhatsApp, an instant messaging smartphone application. Through our interviews with participants, we develop anthopologist Tim Ingold's notion of dwelling, and discuss how use of WhatsApp is constitutive of a felt-life of being together with those close by. We focus on the relationship "doings" in WhatsApp and how this togetherness and intimacy are enacted through small, continuous traces of narrative, of tellings and tidbits, noticings and thoughts, shared images and lingering pauses; this is constitutive of dwelling. Further, we discuss how an intimate knowing of others in these relationships, through past encounters and knowledge of coming together in the future, pertain to the particular forms of relationship engagements manifest through the possibilities presented in WhatsApp. We suggest that this form of sociality is likely to be manifest in other smartphone IM-like applications.},

	Abstract = {While HCI has focused on multitasking with information workers, we report on multitasking among Millennials who grew up with digital media - focusing on college students. We logged computer activity and used biosensors to measure stress of 48 students for 7 days for all waking hours, in their in situ environments. We found a significant positive relationship with stress and daily time spent on computers. Stress is positively associated with the amount of multitasking. Conversely, stress is negatively associated with Facebook and social media use. Heavy multitaskers use significantly more social media and report lower positive affect than light multitaskers. Night habits affect multitasking the following day: late-nighters show longer duration of computer use and those ending their activities earlier in the day multitask less. Our study shows that college students multitask at double the frequency compared to studies of information workers. These results can inform designs for stress management of college students.},

	Abstract = {This book argues that the plethora of new genres, apps and services in digital personal media must be understood historically and sociologically, and insists that sociology, media and communication theory can provide insight beyond surveys on media use and effects. It introduces key terms like 'personal media', 'personalisation' and the 'lifeworld' in order to embed current media use in a proper historical context and theoretical framework. Theorists like McLuhan, Goffman, Habermas, Luhmann, Bauman, de Certeau and Foucault are discussed to indicate the formative power of personal media in daily life. This book argues that mass communication models will not do in examining the use of personal media. Key communication theories are discussed along with the concepts of skills, social capital and social network.

	Abstract = {Low-cost and commercially available 3D printers are predicted to be the next disruptive innovation in technology. However, little research has examined how non-designers might interact with fabrication tools in their homes. To explore the potential uses of 3D printers and other fabrication devices in the home, we conducted a study in which 10 households (with 28 individuals) kept a faux 3D printer in their homes for four weeks. Participants kept a log of items that they would want to print, and completed a series of design probes. We found that participants' use of the fabrication tools involved three activities: replicating existing objects, modifying and customizing existing objects, and creating new custom objects. Our study also provides insights on the types of objects that individuals wish to create, and how the faux 3D printer was situated in our participants' homes.},

	Abstract = {Automation permeates everyday life in the disguise of fully-automated coffee makers, dishwashers, or self-driving cars. While being convenient, such automation may have detrimental effects on the experience gained through the (semi-)automated activity. This paper argues to be more sensitive to the experiential costs of everyday automation. To this end, it provides an in-depth quantitative and qualitative comparison of a more automated and a more manual way of brewing coffee. Brewing coffee manually was more positive and more need fulfilling. This was due to the more intense experience of competence and stimulation. Automation focused people on the outcome. The process became meaningless, degraded to "waiting time." Overall, the experience became "flat", significantly less meaningful and enjoyable, but also less demanding. Automation turned a potentially experience-rich activity into something less satisfactory for the sake of convenience. Since we believe that technology should make everyday activities experientially richer rather than "designing them away," we discuss the emerging challenges for an experiential design of everyday automation.},

	Abstract = {Managing chronic conditions can be challenging. People in such conditions, and the people around them, have to: deal with symptoms, adapt to the resulting disability, manage emotions, and change habits to keep the condition under control. Self-care technologies have the potential to support self-care and mediate the relationship between patients (and caregivers) and the condition. However, these technologies often disregard the complexity of the settings in which they are used and fail to become integrated in everyday life. In this workshop we will discuss how to design self-care technologies that are in harmony with people's everyday life. Therefore, we invite designers, researchers and practitioners to participate in a full-day workshop in which we will reflect on each other's work, and do a design exercise with patients and caregivers.},

	Abstract = { Routine is a central feature of everyday life, yet its peculiar rhythms, and the range of experiences associated with it, are often neglected within cultural studies and sociology. Simmel's attempt to provide a sociological aesthetics is seen as a project that needs reanimating for the study of everyday life routines. This does not mean, however, that Simmel is the only, or the best, guide to the aesthetic dimensions of everyday routine life. In an attempt to provide some co-ordinates for instigating a socio-aesthetic approach to routine, this paper discusses a number of writers who couple aesthetics and the everyday, and who might provide frameworks for the study of experiential aspects of routine life. It also suggests that an inverted reading of John Dewey could provide socio-aesthetic study with the `formless' forms required to bring everyday background routines into the foreground. The socio-aesthetic study of cooking undertaken by Luce Giard provides an example of the complexity of such an approach. Lastly the article looks briefly at new directions for `everyday life aesthetics', more specifically at Henri Lefebvre's unfinished project of rhythmanalysis. },

	Abstract = {→ Non-use goes beyond the absence of technology.
→ Use and non-use are not binary opposites but represent different configurations of sociotechnical practice.
→ Studying these sociotechnical configurations opens up central questions around ``the user'' in HCI.},

	Address = {New York, NY, USA},
	Annote = {"non-use could be understood not as an identity, where a given individual is either a user or a non-user, but rather as a continually negotiated practice. For example, Alex Leavitt's work studying situational non-use of Google Glass points to the moment-to-moment negotiations, often around privacy, between the Glass wearer and others about when and how the technology should (and should not) be used. Thus, a given individual is neither a user nor a non-user, but rather constantly (re) negotiates dis/engagement with the technology."

"Only two professions refer to their clients as users: designers and drug dealers. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that some of the language used to describe technology (non)use draws on that of substance abuse, indulgence, and addiction."

"we may question whether forms of non-use represent the exercise of agency or the giving up of agency. Erin Brady t al. discuss a similar structural limitation where non-use of assistive technologies designed for the visually impaired arose in part from a lack of information but also in part from a lack of access. Such individuals have not chosen to forego use of a particular technology but never had (the agency to make) the choice in the first place."

"just as we recognize that non-use may be non-volitional, we must also consider the possibilty of non-volitional use"

"a useful analytic lever for unpacking and deconstructing the notion of user"

"sociologically speaking, non-use obtains visibility or salience when the diffusion of a technology crosses some threshold of ubiquity, at which point non-use becomse th exception and thus notably conspicuous."

non-use is only interesting when its about a "general-purpose" technology -- e.g. not being a "zamboni" user is obvious, not being a "hammer" user is less obvious

"Rachel Magee et al describe how many peopel assume a 'digital natives' narrative about teen technology use. In contrast, their work takes an ecological approach to show how teens' non/use does not hing on individual technologies but rather is often positioned in relation to a complex array of devices and systems"

non-use provides a counter-narrative to the "technological panacea" narative of Silicon Valley (that "technology " "can solve virtually any problem and improve quality of life for virtually any person" > jurgenson "has drawn attention to this point, arguing that voluntary technological disconnection often is done largely in the service of 'recharging' to enable more effective subsequent reconnection." 

"the differences between these two narratives are reminiscent of the 'digital imperative' that techological adoption and proliferation is not only desirable but unavoidable. Studying non-use can problematize this imperative, calling into quesiton the fundamental premise of both the value and the unavoidability of such technologies." [citing on digital imperative point: Uotinen, J. "Infolvement in (the information) society" New Media and Society; 2003.)

Leading Baumer et al to ask "What if, however, those who do not use a technology do so not from a lack of opportunity but rather from a lack of desire? What if certain individuals or groups prefer to stay on the far side of the digital divide?"

"Finally, what is the symptomatology of non-use? That is, of what underlying condition is non-use symptomatic? This question might be approached in (at least) two ways. First we can ask why various forms of non-use occur as social practices. Hwere, one might argue that cyceles of non-use and overuse [citing me] are symptomatic of a broader lack of ability to control the information flows in which one is involved. Second, we might ask of what underlying academic condition is our scholarly interest in non-use symptomatic? [no answer]"

Future work "may find common ground in developing a critical language that problematizes use, users, and the inevitability of technology spread."

"Studying non-use in its various forms can help us reconsider the foundational questions about what we mean when we talk about use and users in studying human-computer interaction and sociotechnical systems"

	Abstract = { This essay is a contribution to an emergent investigation into the usefulness of ``mood'' as an analytic category for communication and cultural studies. In it I offer a number of descriptive moodscapes that demonstrate the way that mood can direct us to a material world of orientation, attunement, and atmosphere. I also suggest that cultural studies, as a writerly form, can also engage generatively with mood as a productive and political project. },

	Abstract = {This article proposes a new bi-directional way of understanding the convergence of biology and computing. It argues for a reciprocal interaction in which biology and computing have shaped and are currently reshaping each other. In so doing, we qualify both the view of a natural marriage and of a digital shaping of biology, which are common in the literature written by scientists, STS, and communication scholars. The DNA database is at the center of this interaction. We argue that DNA databases are spaces of convergence for computing and biology that change in form, meaning, and function from the 1960s to the 2000s. The first part of the article shows how, in the 1980s, DNA sequencing shifted from passively incorporating computers to be increasingly modeled in digital coding and decoding. Information retrieval algorithms, reciprocally, were altered according to the peculiarities of DNA in the first sequence-storage databases. The second part of the article investigates the impact of these reciprocal interactions and globalization on the organization of research centers, ways of conducting big science, and scientific values. Through convergence and new technologies such as data mining, biology and computing were transformed technologically, institutionally, and culturally into a new bio-data enterprise called genomics.},

@article{Darling:2015,
	Abstract = {The US National Institute of Health's Human Microbiome Project aims to use genomic techniques to understand the microbial communities that live on the human body. The emergent field of microbiome science brought together diverse disciplinary perspectives and technologies, thus facilitating the negotiation of differing values. Here, we describe how values are conceptualized and negotiated within microbiome research. Analyzing discussions from a series of interdisciplinary workshops conducted with microbiome researchers, we argue that negotiations of epistemic, social, and institutional values were inextricable from the reflective and strategic category work (i.e., the work of anticipating and strategizing around divergent sets of institutional categories) that defined and organized the microbiome as an object of study and a potential future site of biomedical intervention. Negotiating the divergence or tension between emerging scientific and regulatory classifications also activated ``values levers'' and opened up reflective discussions of how classifications embody values and how these values might differ across domains. These data suggest that scholars at the intersections of science and technology studies, ethics, and policy could leverage such openings to identify and intervene in the ways that ethical/regulatory and scientific/technical practices are coproduced within unfolding research.},

	Abstract = {This paper draws on research on time and technology, with a view to examining the notion that technology is implicated in the speeding up of everyday life. We begin by looking at research that shows how the adoption of the clock and of "clock time" was framed by more general shifts in ways of conceptualising and using time. Likewise, we suggest that the ways in which digital technologies are said to shape experiences of time need to be understood in the context of the fractured routines of the modern Western world. We argue that "redesigning" these experiences necessitates a broader way of dealing with the temporal structures of social life. Technology may play various roles here, for instance by shaping temporal infrastructures and highlighting reified temporal patterns. However, complex challenges also need to be addressed, central to which are recent accounts that position time as collective and entangled.

In this paper, we take a careful look at research that indi- cates how technology is bound up with experiences of time. We begin with a classic example of this: the adoption of the clock and of `clock time', by considering research that shows how the introduction of the clock was framed by broader sociocultural shifts in ways of thinking about and using time. We then consider ways in which the experience of `digital' time is linked to the fractured routines of the modern Western world, with digital technologies having evolved alongside increased flexibility of personal sched- ules and variance of leisure and work rhythms. This leads us to argue that `redesigning' the experience of time as me- diated by technologies necessitates a broader way of deal- ing with the rhythms and routines that frame their use. We consider what role technology might play in this, through shaping temporal infrastructures and shifting reified tem- poral patterns. We conclude by noting the considerable challenges that this entails, especially in view of recent ac- counts that position time as collective and entangled.},

@article{Jasanoff:2009,
	Abstract = {STS research has devoted relatively little attention to the promotion and reception of science and technology by non-scientific actors and institutions. One consequence is that the relationship of science and technology to political power has tended to remain undertheorized. This article aims to fill that gap by introducing the concept of "sociotechnical imaginaries." Through a comparative examination of the development and regulation of nuclear power in the US and South Korea, the article demonstrates the analytic potential of the imaginaries concept. Although nuclear power and nationhood have long been imagined together in both countries, the nature of those imaginations has remained strikingly different. In the US, the state's central move was to present itself as a responsible regulator of a potentially runaway technology that demands effective "containment." In South Korea, the dominant imaginary was of "atoms for development" which the state not only imported but incorporated into its scientific, technological and political practices. In turn, these disparate imaginaries have underwritten very different responses to a variety of nuclear shocks and challenges, such as Three Mile Island (TMI), Chernobyl, and the spread of the anti-nuclear movement.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the widespread proposition that the mobile phone dissolves the boundaries that separate work and home, extending the reach of work. It analyses data derived from a purpose-designed survey to study social practices surrounding mobile phone use.The key components of the survey investigated here are a questionnaire and a log of phone calls retrieved from respondents' handsets. Rather than being primarily a tool of work extension, or even a tool that facilitates greater work-family balance, we show that the main purpose of mobile phone calls is to maintain continuing connections with family and friends. Our findings suggest that individuals exert control over the extent to which calls invade their personal time, actively encouraging deeper contacts with intimates.},

@article{Allen:2005,
	Abstract = { Purpose -- To identify, classify, and propose a preliminary theory of the value conflicts and social choices that arise in enterprise system use.Design/methodology/approach -- Ethnographic case study of a medium‐sized manufacturing firm, using a participant‐observer approach.Findings -- Three areas of value conflict are identified between functional areas: conflicts over work priorities, conflicts over dependency on the commitments of others, and conflicts over evaluation fairness. When participants perceived that the value conflicts were accommodated in a balanced and legitimate way, they chose to use information resources within the enterprise system. When the conflicts were perceived as too great, participants chose to ignore the enterprise system, or develop their own competing information resources.Research limitations/implications -- This paper reports on theory building from one intensive case study. It implies, however, that previous attempts to account for the difficulty of enterprise resource planning (ERP) use have not focused enough on the social relationships between the functional areas that are tightly integrated through enterprise systems.Practical implications -- The three value conflict questions (work priorities, dependency on commitments, and evaluation fairness) can be used to identify potential ERP problem areas, and to clarify the costs and benefits of different ERP choices for various functional areas.Originality/value -- For information systems researchers and practitioners, this paper offers another means for identifying value conflicts and social choices in computerization, hopefully bringing us closer to Rob Kling's dream that computerization choices be made in a more socially benign way. },

	Abstract = { Purpose -- To provide a view of Rob Kling's contribution to socio‐technical studies of work.Design/methodology/approach -- The five ``big ideas'' discussed are signature themes in Kling's own work in the informatics domain, and of his intellectual legacy.Findings -- This paper conveys something of Kling's presence in social informatics (SI) thinking by focusing on a number of ``big'' ideas -- ``multiple points of view'', ``social choices'', ``the production lattice'' (and its corollary, the problematization of the user), ``socio‐technical interaction networks'', and ``institutional truth regimes''.Research limitations/implications -- A growing research community has demonstrated the power of SI techniques. It is essential that this body of work is sustained and developed, demonstrating how to undertake investigation and observation, that is not driven by instrumentalism but is informed by and leads to ``technological realism''.Practical implications -- The SI corpus, exposing the dangers of na{\"\i}ve instrumentalism as an approach to information systems design and management, can guide practitioners on how to unpack the history of what is in view. This may be a specific technology, a social formation, or a sociotechnical circumstance. Practitioners may draw on the concepts presented, not as a prescriptive toolkit, but rather as a sensitizing frame to assist those who wish to re‐vision the workplace.Originality/value -- Central to the successful utilisation of computers in work, we argue, is the continuing development of a portfolio of interpretive concepts (such as STINs, regimes of truth, production lattices) that can consolidate Rob Kling's ``big'' ideas that are the core of this paper. },

@article{Portwood-Stacer:2013,
	Abstract = {This paper is a study of consumer resistance among active abstainers of the Facebook social network site. I analyze the discourses invoked by individuals who consciously choose to abstain from participation on the ubiquitous Facebook platform. This discourse analysis draws from approximately 100 web and print publications from 2006 to early 2012, as well as personal interviews conducted with 20 Facebook abstainers. I conceptualize Facebook abstention as a performative mode of resistance, which must be understood within the context of a neoliberal consumer culture, in which subjects are empowered to act through consumption choices -- or in this case non-consumption choices -- and through the public display of those choices. I argue that such public displays are always at risk of misinterpretation due to the dominant discursive frameworks through which abstention is given meaning. This paper gives particular attention to the ways in which connotations of taste and distinction are invoked by refusers through their conspicuous displays of non-consumption. This has the effect of framing refusal as a performance of elitism, which may work against observers interpreting conscientious refusal as a persuasive and emulable practice of critique. The implication of this is that refusal is a limited tactic of political engagement where media platforms are concerned.},

This article addresses that gap through a historical discourse analysis of the emergence of discursive resistance to social media use across {multipleU}.S.sociocultural realms. I analyze forms of pushback that became widely visible online between 2009 and 2011 and examine indicators of their emergence. Leveraging concerns about the ubiquity and constancy of digital {ICTs} more generally, I map ways that resistance to social media was framed in regards to work and organizational dynamics, politics, and the military, as well as personal and relational issues---motivated by distinct yet related reasons.},

	Abstract = {An ever-increasing number of us live in a world rich in information and media that provide us with constant access to that information. Besides television, radio, newspapers, and computers, we now carry communication devices with us. Mobile devices with digital content --- phones, iPods, PDAs --- have become ubiquitous around the world, creating an information environment with as yet unknown consequences for the way we function and the way we think and feel. This study examines responses from students at 12 universities from 10 nations who tried to avoid all ``media'' for 24 hours and reflect on their experience, and considers the data in the context of ambient media in hopes of better understanding the effects of living in a world of ambient media.},

	Abstract = {In times when media are mundane fellows that are disappearing from our consciousness; when media usage is partly habitualized and therefore invisible, looking at disconnections rather than exclusively connection enables us to develop a deeper understanding of what it means to live in mediatized worlds. Media disconnection beyond digital divide and knowledge gap is, however, rarely addressed in current studies of mediatization. This paper is an attempt to explore specific forms of disconnection in conjunction with connection enabled by media. By using forced disruption of the daily stream of online engagement as a method, the article discusses how online disconnection can contribute to an understanding of media participation and its role in the everyday lives of young adults.},

	Abstract = {A group of young adults were observed and interviewed as they spent a weekend without access to the mobile phone and Internet. Thirty-seven students participated in a program, entitled ``unplugged weekend.'' How they experienced the social interactions and flow of time without the usual interruption by mobile communication was the main point of examination. Contrary to our expectations, the 48-hour period of disconnection was judged to be a unique, entertaining, and satisfactory experience for most participants. Using humor, establishing common grounds, and uses of the body were three main characteristics of co-present social interactions observed during the trip. There were ``dual'' perceptions of time flow: Some reported that time slowed down whereas others reported that time flew rather quickly throughout the weekend. Overall, many participants rediscovered the value of co-present embodied interactions by sharing various activities while giving undivided attention to one another.},

	Abstract = {Despite the high-profile nature of the current {\^a}€˜digital divide{\^a}€{\texttrademark} debate, academic understanding of who is making little or no use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) remains weak. Indeed much of the discussion surrounding the digital divide has concentrated on the characteristics of those individuals who are using \{ICTs\} or, at best, simply pathologised the {\^a}€˜have nots{\^a}€{\texttrademark} in terms of individual deficits. Yet developing a systematic and objective understanding of individuals{\^a}€{\texttrademark} non-use of new technologies constitutes a major challenge for those seeking to map and understand the social realities of the {\^a}€˜information age{\^a}€{\texttrademark}. The present paper, therefore, aims to develop a deeper conceptual understanding of people{\^a}€{\texttrademark}s non-use of new technologies: firstly, by considering established discourses of why individuals may be excluded or peripheral to \{ICT\} use; and then, via a critique of these positions, proposing an alternative framework of why people may not use \{ICT\} in their day-to-day lives based around individuals{\^a}€{\texttrademark} {\^a}€˜reading{\^a}€{\texttrademark} of technology. },

	Abstract = {As a result of the widespread connectivity provided by smartphones, laptops, and tablets, technology users can and often are continuously connected to the Internet and its communication services, a phenomenon some start to call ``evertime.'' However, many users who first embraced constant connectivity are now pushing back, looking for ways to resist being permanently connected and contactable. This pushback behavior is increasingly visible in the popular press, in personal blogs, and in a small number of academic studies. ``Pushback'' is a growing phenomenon among frequent technology users seeking to regain control, establish boundaries, resist information overload, and establish greater personal life balance. This study examines a growing body of both academic and non--academic literature, and identifies five primary motivations and five primary behaviors related to pushback. Primary pushback motivations include emotional dissatisfaction, external values, taking control, addiction, and privacy. Primary pushback behaviors are behavior adaptation, social agreement, no problem, tech control, and back to the woods. The implications these pushback motivations and behaviors pose to communication technology are discussed.},

@article{Wolf-Meyer:2011,
	Abstract = {American capitalism finds its force and legitimacy in hegemonic understandings of nature and society, especially as expressed in human biology. In this article, I address the ways American capitalism depends on the deployment of sleep and wakefulness within the institutional contexts of school and labor, with particular attention to the recent medicalization of sleep disorders. Across American institutions and social science literature, I argue that sleep, like capitalism, has been discursively ascribed the powers of inevitability and universality, rendering them both transhistorically natural. To make these claims, I draw on ethnographic research in sleep clinics with scientists and clinicians, interviews with disordered sleepers, and textual and policy analysis. In conclusion, I offer suggestions toward elucidating the historical and continuing biopolitical projects of capitalism.},

The ambivalent stance of these individuals creates a number of special challenges and opportunities. Based on interviews, conversations, personal reflections, and archival reports, this paper describes the special circumstances faced by tempered radicals and documents some of the strategies used by these individuals as they try to make change in their organizations and sustain their ambivalent identities.},

@article{Hanson:2013,
	Abstract = {Le Guin's overlooked prologue story ``The Day Before the Revolution'' (1974) is crucial for understanding the onset of social stagnation that plagues the utopian society of Anarres in The Dispossessed. I contend that the way the anarchist leader Laia Odo is remembered and commemorated by her followers in ``The Day Before the Revolution'' continues to play out in the novel, which is set 150 years later. Using theories and models of collective memory developed by such cultural historians as Pierre Nora, Wulf Kansteiner, and Nancy Wood, the paper demonstrates that Anarres's move toward centralization of power and social conformity stems largely from how Odo and her ideas are collectively remembered. Rather than being the embodiment of ongoing anarchist freedom and development, Odo is remembered as a ``monument,'' an unchanging site of archival memory. To counter the ossifying tendencies of collective memory, Le Guin asserts that such individuals as Shevek must bring the past (and the future) into the present to preserve the utopian impulse.},

La science-fiction, comme genre {\'e}mergeant, est {\`a} voir comme le substitut de ce qu'{\'e}tait le roman historique pour la conscience de classe bourgeoise au d{\'e}but du 19e si{\`e}cle (selon Luk{\'a}cs). De m{\^e}me que le roman historique, ses repr{\'e}sentations ne visent qu'en apparence cet autre du pr{\'e}sent qui serait l'avenir ou le pass{\'e}; en fait, ses d{\'e}tours narratifs sont autant de strat{\'e}gies pour rendre l'historicit{\'e} de plus en plus inaccessible dans nos soci{\'e}t{\'e}s actuelles.

@article{Tomberg:2013,
	Abstract = {The article deals with the convergence of mimetic realism and science-fictional estrangement in William Gibson's recent novels. It postulates that the poetics of Gibson's Bigend Trilogy---Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2011)---can be read as both realism and science fiction with equal plausibility. Contemplating the sf genre theories of Darko Suvin and John Rieder, Seo-Young Chu's science-fictional theory of representation, and Michael Hardt's and Antonio Negri's notion of a lack of an outside, the article explores and outlines the possible generic, cultural, and poetic conditions that enable science-fictional estrangement and realist plausibility indiscernibly to inhabit one and the same textual space in the poetics of William Gibson's new-century oeuvre.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a brief review of the constitution and development of utopia as a field of study, with an emphasis on the years preceding its revival in the 1970s. The study follows a similar trajectory to the one outlined in various articles in the special issue of SFS devoted to the history of sf criticism (#78, July 1999)-a growing awareness, first of all, that there are similarities between certain works which lead to attempts to group together such works as well as to identify what they have in common and to give this new genre a name. In the case of utopia, awareness of a new genre can be traced to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as writers imitate More's Utopia (1516), often taking advantage of the imaginary voyage to imagine alternative societies. Until the nineteenth century, however, most commentators continued to use such terms as "political," "allegorical," or "philosophical" to refer to literary utopias, and it was only in the nineteenth century that we can observe the emergence of the term utopia to designate these works. The next step (in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries) was to try to develop a canon of these works, one which, until the 1950s, often explicitly excluded science fiction. The study of utopia took on new life following the upsurge in utopian writing at the beginning of the 1970s.},

@article{Newell:2009,
	Abstract = {Although Judith Merril is well known as an important editor and anthologist during the formative period of North American sf from the 1940s through the 1970s, her fiction has been largely overlooked by sf scholars. Even feminist work tends to proceed from the assumption that women did not become an important force in sf until the 1970s, and so excludes Merril's writing from consideration as feminist sf. This article reconsiders the importance of Judith Merril as an sf writer, arguing that she played a far more central role in the emergence of feminist sf than has generally been acknowledged. Our critical framework situates Merril's writing in the context of frontier themes in science fiction, which gained prominence and respect in American culture as the US space program opened up what many observers of the day considered a new phase in America's legacy as a frontiering nation. Just as feminist scholars of women's writing of the American west have identified differing patterns in how women write about the western frontier, we similarly identify key ways in which Merril's space frontier departs from male-centered paradigms, particularly with respect to her representations of gender and gender relations in space, the remaking of the family in space and in newly contacted worlds, and the point of view of both the colonizers and colonized in space. Her innovative fiction, we argue, qualifies her as a founding figure in the history of feminist sf, as well as one of the most important writers of the mid-twentieth century.},

@article{Jackson:2014,
	Abstract = {Science studies has long been concerned with the theoretical and methodological challenge of mess---the inevitable tendency of technoscientific objects and practices to spill beyond the neat analytic categories we (or their actors) construct for them. Nowhere is this challenge greater than in the messy world of large-scale collaborative science projects, particularly though not exclusively in their start-up phases. This article examines the complicated life and death of the WATERS Network, an ambitious and ultimately abandoned effort at collaborative infrastructure development among hydrologists, engineers, and social scientists studying water. We argue in particular against the ``forensic imagination,'' a particular style of accounting for failure in the messy world of large-scale network development, and against two common conceptual and empirical pitfalls that it gives rise to: defaults to formalism and defaults to the future. We argue that alternative postforensic approaches to ``failures'' like the WATERS Network can support forms of learning and accountability better attuned to the complexities of practice and policy in the real world of scientific collaboration and network formation.},

@article{Wharton:2009,
	Abstract = {{Emotional labor refers to the process by which workers are expected to
   manage their feelings in accordance with organizationally defined rules
   and guidelines. Hochschild's (1983) The Managed Heart introduced this
   concept and inspired an outpouring of research on this topic. This
   article reviews theory and research on emotional labor with a particular
   focus on its contributions to sociological understandings of workers and
   jobs. The sociological literature on emotional labor can be roughly
   divided into two major streams of research. These include studies of
   interactive work and research directly focused on emotions and their
   management by workers. The first uses emotional labor as a vehicle to
   understand the organization, structure, and social relations of service
   jobs, while the second focuses on individuals' efforts to express and
   regulate emotion and the consequences of those efforts. The concept of
   emotional labor has motivated a tremendous amount of research, but it
   has been much less helpful in providing theoretical guidance for or
   integration of the results generated by these bodies of work.}},

@book{Lave:1991,
	Abstract = {In this important theoretical treatise, Jean Lave, anthropologist, and Etienne
Wenger, computer scientist, push forward the notion of situated learning--that
learning is fundamentally a social process and not solely in the learner's
head. The authors maintain that learning viewed as situated activity has as
its central defining characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral
participation. Learners participate in communities of practitioners, moving
toward full participation in the sociocultural practices of a community.
Legitimate peripheral participation provides a way to speak about crucial
relations between newcomers and oldtimers and about their activities,
identities, artifacts, knowledge and practice. The communities discussed in
the book are midwives, tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering
alcoholics, however, the process by which participants in those communities
learn can be generalized to other social groups.},

@book{Clark:2003,
	Abstract = {From the {Publisher:In} Natural-Born Cyborgs, Clark argues that what makes humans so different from other species is our capacity to fully incorporate tools and supporting cultural practices into our existence. Technology as simple as writing on a sketchpad, as familiar as Google or a cellular phone, and as potentially revolutionary as mind-extending neural implants - all exploit our brains' astonishingly plastic nature. Our minds are primed to seek out and incorporate nonbiological resources, so that we actually think and feel through our best technologies. Drawing on his expertise in cognitive science, Clark demonstrates that our sense of self and of physical presence can be expanded to a remarkable extent, placing the long-existing telephone and the emerging technology of telepresence on the same continuum. He explores ways in which we have adapted our lives to make use of technology (the measurement of time, for example, has wrought enormous changes in human existence), as well as ways in which increasingly fluid technologies can adapt to individual users during normal use. Bio-technological unions, Clark argues, are evolving with a speed never seen before in history. As we enter an age of wearable computers, sensory augmentation, wireless devices, intelligent environments, thought-controlled prosthetics, and rapid-fire information search and retrieval, the line between the user and her tools grows thinner day by day. {"This} double whammy of plastic brains and increasingly responsive and well-fitted tools creates an unprecedented opportunity for ever-closer kinds of human-machine merger," he writes, arguing that such a merger is entirely natural.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we seek to contribute to the Ubiquitous Computing agenda by focusing on one of its earliest, but most difficult, design ambitions - making technology "invisible in use". We draw on field studies of domestic life as this domain is becoming increasingly important for new technologies and challenges many of the assumptions we take for granted in the design of technologies for the workplace. We use some examples of domestic routines to identify a number of insights into what it means for features of activities to be "unremarkable". We conclude by using these insights to critique some of the current emphases in Ubiquitous Computing research, and suggest how we might better understand the {HCI} issues of what will be required to develop technologies that really are "invisible in use"},

@article{Orlikowski:2001,
	Abstract = {The field of information systems is premised on the centrality of information technology in everyday socio-economic life. Yet, drawing on a review of the full set of articles published in Information Systems Research {(ISR)} over the past ten years, we argue that the field has not deeply engaged its core subject matter--the information technology {(IT)} artifact. Instead, we find that {IS} researchers tend to give central theoretical significance to the context (within which some usually unspecified technology is seen to operate), the discrete processing capabilities of the artifact (as separable from its context or use), or the dependent variable (that which is posited to be affected or changed as technology is developed, implemented, and used). The {IT} artifact itself tends to disappear from view, be taken for granted, or is presumed to be unproblematic once it is built and installed. After discussing the implications of our findings, we propose a research direction for the {IS} field that begins to take technology as seriously as its effects, context, and capabilities. In particular, we propose that {IS} researchers begin to theorize specifically about {IT} artifacts, and then incorporate these theories explicitly into their studies. We believe that such a research direction is critical if {IS} research is to make a significant contribution to the understanding of a world increasingly suffused with ubiquitous, interdependent, and emergent information technologies.},

To approach the study of infrastructure from an ethnographic perspective, we conducted an exploratory field study of people for whom infrastructure had become visible due to some form of active engagement (rejecting, augmenting, or caretaking). From considering together individuals as disparate as homeschoolers, gated community dwellers, and voluntary simplicity advocates, a number of challenges and opportunities for ubicomp emerged in terms of appropriation, empowerment, and reflection.},

	Abstract = {When we think of mobility in technical terms, we think of topics such as bandwidth, resource management, location, and wireless networks. When we think of mobility in social or cultural terms, a different set of topics come into view: pilgrimage and religious practice, globalization and economic disparities, migration and cultural identity, daily commutes and the suburbanization of cities.
In this paper, we examine the links between these two aspects of mobility. Drawing on non-technological examples of cultural encounters with space, we argue that mobile information technologies do not just operate in space, but they are tools that serve to structure the spaces through which they move. We use recent projects to illustrate how three concerns with mobility and space--legibility, literacy, and legitimacy--open up new avenues for design exploration and analysis.},

@article{Bell:2005,
	Abstract = {This article argues that because the home is so familiar, it is necessary to make it strange, or defamiliarize it, in order to open its design space. Critical approaches to technology design are of both practical and social importance in the home. Home appliances are loaded with cultural associations such as the gendered division of domestic labor that are easy to overlook. Further, homes are not the same everywhere---even within a country. Peoples' aspirations and desires differ greatly across and between cultures. The target of western domestic technology design is often not the user, but the consumer. Web refrigerators that create shopping lists, garbage cans that let advertisers know what is thrown away, cabinets that monitor their contents and order more when supplies are low are central to current images of the wireless, digital home of the future. Drawing from our research in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia, we provide three different narratives of defamiliarization. A historical reading of American kitchens provides a lens with which to scrutinize new technologies of domesticity, an ethnographic account of an extended social unit in England problematizes taken-for-granted domestic technologies, and a comparative ethnography of the role of information and communication technologies in the daily lives of urban Asia's middle classes reveals the ways in which new technologies can be captured and domesticated in unexpected ways. In the final section of the article, we build on these moments of defamiliarization to suggest a broad set of challenges and strategies for design in the home.},

	Abstract = {Although ethnography has become a common approach in {HCI} research and design, considerable confusion still attends both ethnographic practice and the criteria by which it should be evaluated in {HCI.} Often, ethnography is seen as an approach to field investigation that can generate requirements for systems development; by that token, the major evaluative criterion for an ethnographic study is the implications it can provide for design. Exploring the nature of ethnographic inquiry, this paper suggests that "implications for design" may not be the best metric for evaluation and may, indeed, fail to capture the value of ethnographic investigations.},

	Abstract = {What happens when an organization provides employees a technology that enables constant connectivity to email? How and why do some groups manage the potential for connectivity in a way that increases flexibility on the job and personal 'free' time, while others create expectations of expanded accessibility to work? A three-year qualitative study of the enactment of mobile email devices in a footwear manufacturer provides empirical grounding to address these questions. Focusing on the experience of two occupational functions, this research argues that congruent frames of heterogeneous communication practices enabled one group to develop communication norms that circumvented the trap of constant connectivity, while assumptions of homogeneous communication practices in the other group led to expanded accessibility and erosion of personal time. This study examines how such alternate trajectories of use emerged and discusses the key dimensions of difference between groups - identity, materiality, vulnerability and visibility - that help account for these differences. In introducing the distinction between homogeneous and heterogeneous trajectories of use, and explicating how such trajectories emerge, this paper offers several theoretical insights: it suggests that there is a distinction between the congruence of technological frames of reference and the content of these frames; it provides an explanation for why groups might enact mobile communication technologies in a manner that does not lead to constant connectivity; and it highlights how shared assumptions of heterogeneity relate to systems of social control.},

@article{Barley:2011,
	Abstract = {The increasing volume of e-mail and other technologically enabled communications are widely regarded as a growing source of stress in people's lives. Yet research also suggests that new media afford people additional flexibility and control by enabling them to communicate from anywhere at any time. Using a combination of quantitative and qualitative data, this paper builds theory that unravels this apparent contradiction. As the literature would predict, we found that the more time people spent handling e-mail, the greater was their sense of being overloaded, and the more e-mail they processed, the greater their perceived ability to cope. Contrary to assumptions of prior studies, we found no evidence that time spent working mediates e-mail-related overload. Instead, e-mail's material properties entwined with social norms and interpretations in a way that led informants to single out e-mail as a cultural symbol of the overload they experience in their lives. Moreover, by serving as a symbol, e-mail distracted people from recognizing other sources of overload in their work lives. Our study deepens our understanding of the impact of communication technologies on people's lives and helps untangle those technologies' seemingly contradictory influences.},
	Annote = {Barley et al. make a particularly compelling empirical argument about how stories come to matter in the contemporary world. Interviewing working professionals who were  concerned with ``overload'' and ``stress,'' they heard numerous reports that e-mail was a key source of these problems. However, he and his team of psychologists found that other factors (time spent in meetings, for example) are correlated much more significantly with measures of stress and overload, suggesting that the strength of the cultural symbol distracts people from addressing the ``real'' problems. },

@article{Landstrom:2007,
	Abstract = {This article argues that the influence of heteronormativity on the conceptualization of women and technology in feminist constructivist technology studies creates serious problems for the analysis. This research aims to understand the coproduction of gender and technology in society, but does not approach the two elements in a symmetrical fashion. Hence, ethnographic studies can only exemplify how the gender of technology producers is reflected in the technology created. Masculine gender identity is stabilized as a cause for the masculinity of a technology that is shaped by social relationships. The criticism is fleshed out in a close examination of case study accounts of ethnographies among producers and users of technology. It is argued that a habitual reproduction of heteronormativity, present in the surrounding culture and in the technological communities studied, has prevented the adoption of approaches to the subject conducive to the objective of this feminist research. Acknowledging that destabilizing gender can undermine the critical thrust of feminist critique, the paper turns towards queer theory for ideas about how to produce criticism that does not rely on the stability of identity. The article closes with suggesting how a queer feminist approach could contribute to different readings of life with technology.},

	Abstract = {This article explores how female graduate engineers construct femininities in male-dominated organizations. By applying a dynamic relational understanding of gender it is argued that different versions of femininities are constructed through associations to sameness and difference. The graduate engineering profession is closely connected to hegemonic masculinity, not least by the strong representation of technology and a management system itself heavily connected to current hegemonic masculinity. The female engineers stand in a position which can be described as `the dilemma of difference' that arises when women choose to construct themselves as more or less different from men, or more or less visible as women. They negotiate whether the meaning of gender should mean sameness or difference from men, and they negotiate how to relate to hegemonic masculinity. This inuences the different strategies they choose.},

@inproceedings{Ames:2011,
	Abstract = {This ethnographic study of 22 diverse families in the San Francisco Bay Area provides a holistic account of parents' attitudes about their children's use of technology. We found that parents from different socioeconomic classes have different values and practices around technology use, and that those values and practices reflect structural differences in their everyday lives. Calling attention to class differences in technology use challenges the prevailing practice in human-computer interaction of designing for those similar to oneself, which often privileges middle-class values and practices. By discussing the differences between these two groups and the advantages of researching both, this research highlights the benefits of explicitly engaging with socioeconomic status as a category of analysis in design.},

	Abstract = {
This paper examines the relationship between experiences of busyness in everyday life and the use of productivity tools, including planners, calendars and to-do lists. Field study findings demonstrate that American individuals across a demographic range have internalized a cultural emphasis of busyness as a moral value to construct positive identities as busy individuals. At the same time, they struggle with a sense of conflict around busyness, reflected in real-life experiences of clashing priorities, fantasies of downtime, and struggles with anxiety, guilt, and loss of control. Our findings also point to the ways digital and non-digital productivity tools are embedded in experiences and coping practices around busyness. Grounded in our observations we propose design principles for productivity tools that support users' identities as busy people but also address some of the perils of the American busyness ethic.

	Abstract = {With substantial efforts in ubiquitous computing, ICT4D, and sustainable interaction design, among others, HCI is increasingly engaging with matters of social change that go beyond the immediate qualities of interaction. In doing so, HCI takes on scientific and moral concerns. This paper explores the potential for feminist social science to contribute to and potentially benefit from HCI's rising interest in social change. It describes how feminist contributions to debates in the philosophy of science have helped clarify relationships among objectivity, values, data collection and interpretation, and social consequences. Feminists have proposed and implemented strategies to pursue scientific and moral agendas together and with equal rigor. In this paper, we assess the epistemologies, methodologies, and methods of feminist social science relative to prior and ongoing research efforts in HCI. We conclude by proposing an outline of a feminist HCI methodology.},

In this paper, I summarize the state of the art of feminism in HCI and propose ways to build on existing successes to more robustly integrate feminism into interaction design research and practice. I explore the productive role of feminism in analogous fields, such as industrial design, architecture, and game design. I introduce examples of feminist interaction design already in the field. Finally, I propose a set of femi- nist interaction design qualities intended to support design and evaluation processes directly as they unfold.},

@inproceedings{Cucuzzella:2010,
	Abstract = {Sustainable design is an approach that seeks to adopt an ethic of the future, where the vision of the solutions is based on a temporal and spatial perspective that is predominantly long-term and global. Design is characterized by its projective and ambivalent nature, and therefore a conscious effort to anticipate the outcomes of design intentions is crucial. Consequently, all design is inherently laden with uncertainty, doubt, and specifically in some technology-driven design projects - contradictions and controversies. Typically, such uncertainties and contradictions are not considered during the initial phase, since the main goal at this phase is to simplify the problem, and therefore these anomalies are often omitted, as they are seen to be outside the boundaries of the design problem. How can designers consider the uncertainties and contradictions during conceptualization, as well as consider the benefits resulting from their design proposals? Designers in their sustainable design practice must consider (1) the multiple objectives and criteria; (2) the multiple users and user preferences; (3) the multiple design alternatives; (4) the complex changing global situation; and (5) the knowledge from the various disciplines comprising the design project. A collective systems thinking approach to design addresses these concerns. Consequently, the theoretical basis of the precautionary principle is directly in line with this approach to design. This presentation will discuss the epistemological and practical implications of the precautionary principle for design in this context.},

	Abstract = {The importance of values in design work is gaining increasing attention. However, some of the work to date takes an approach which starts with generic values, or assumes values are constant. Through discussion of three accounts of value discovery and value evolution in projects focused on exploring novel uses of ubiquitous computing, we complement current thinking by arguing for the use of users' values as a resource in the co-design process. In particular, this paper shows how users' values: (a) are spontaneously expressed whether or not particular elicitation methods are used; (b) are not fixed, but can change dynamically during the co-design process in response to ideas, prototypes and demonstrators; (c) help mediate and shape the relationships of users to designers; (d) can support users' creative, functional and technical engagement in co- design -- areas that can often prove difficult. Focusing on practical examples that demonstrate this approach, we conclude that values may act as a central resource for co-design in a larger variety of ways than has hitherto been recognised.},

	Abstract = {This paper explores the role of design within our universal and contemporary culture and will use language related to the most general understanding of design. This language includes references to a client, project or initiative, a designer, a process, and an end user. Each of these roles are understood in an economic sense in which there is a demand for something, a client willing to provide this thing, a designer willing to design this thing, a process that each of them follow, and a user who desires that thing resulting from the process.

Valid and relevant to this paper in its early stages, these linear relationships will grow to occupy new relationships and more dynamic roles in later stages of reading. Instead of a client, the reader may infer an organization with a quantifiable issue or a situation which brings about a problem that requires a solution. Instead of a marketable product or service, the thing may come to reference a more abstract solution. The user may become a general beneficiary of the solution, instead of a consumer in the previously mentioned economic context. Further, although the process is almost always dynamic, the designer remains a designer regardless of task or official title. I ask the reader to bear each of these distinctions in mind as he or she progress through the following exploration of the various roles of design.},

	Abstract = { Abstract The connection between the AIDS epidemic and the efflorescence of religious `enthusiasm' (construed in both classical and contemporary senses) in Africa in recent decades is best understood, this paper argues, by reference to a concept of `spiritual insecurity'. The article offers a general description of the condition of spiritual insecurity and argues that it is best studied within a relational realist paradigm. The article presents a critique of the concept of `belief' as commonly used in the social science of religion, arguing instead for an opening of the study of social relations to include the universe of relations within which people experience the world, including their relations with entities such as spiritual beings that might otherwise be considered virtual. },

@article{Glaskin:2010,
	Abstract = { Amongst Bardi of north-west Western Australia, ilma is a genre of dreamt material that has three interrelated components: song, dance and `totem' (a string and plywood object carried during the dance). These constituent parts, along with the whole, are referred to as ilma. This article considers the social tensions surrounding the commodification of one of these elements, the `totem', as art. The production of ilma for the art market largely precludes the development of associated songs and dances, and their integration into group repertoire, giving rise to tensions between social expectations about such dreamt material and those of the person who dreams them. These tensions reflect Bardi understandings of the provenance of this dreamt material, as ancestrally revealed: hence dreamt songs, dances and objects belonging to this ritual genre are not considered as creative works produced by a person or persons. Contestations over `tradition' and `culture' in this context highlight the tensions between the forces of convention and those of innovation in times of social change, in which the emergence of persons as creative individuals may be understood as signalling broader societal transformation. },

@article{Brenninkmeijer:2010,
	Abstract = {The increasing attention to the brain in science and the media, and people's continuing quest for a better life, have resulted in a successful self-help industry for brain enhancement. Apart from brain books, foods and games, there are several devices on the market that people can use to stimulate their brains and become happier, healthier or more successful. People can, for example, switch their brain state into relaxation or concentration with a light-and-sound machine, they can train their brainwaves to cure their Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or solve their sleeping problems with a neurofeedback device, or they can influence the firing of their neurons with electric or magnetic stimulation to overcome their depression and anxieties. Working on your self with a brain device can be seen as a contemporary form of Michel Foucault's `technologies of the self'. Foucault described how since antiquity people had used techniques such as reading manuscripts, listening to teachers, or saying prayers to `act on their selves' and control their own thoughts and behaviours. Different techniques, Foucault stated, are based on different precepts and constitute different selves. I follow Foucault by stating that using a brain device for self-improvement indeed constitutes a new self. Drawing on interviews with users of brain devices and observations of the practices in brain clinics, I analyse how a new self takes shape in the use of brain devices; not a monistic (neuroscientific) self, but a `layered' self of all kinds of entities that exchange and control each other continuously.},

@article{Biehl:2009,
	Abstract = {In the domain of health, not only are the raw effects of economic, social, and medical inequalities continually devastating, but novel processes of reconfiguring illness experience, subjectivity, and control are also underway. Human relationships to medical technology are increasingly constituted outside the clinical encounter. In this article we explore how the domestic encroachment of medical commodities affects social bonds in both affluent and resource-poor contexts, as well as how these commodities become interwoven in the very fabric of symptoms and identities. Symptoms are more than contingent matters; they are, at times, a necessary condition for the afflicted to articulate a new relationship to the world and to others. In exploring how people conceptualize technological self-care, we are specifically concerned with disciplinary modes of evidence-making and ask the following: what are the possibilities and limitations of theoretical frameworks (such as structural violence, biopower, social suffering, and psychoanalysis) through which these conceptions are being analyzed in contemporary anthropological scholarship? What can the unique capacities of ethnography add to the task of capturing the active embroilment of reason, life, and ethics as human conditions are shaped and lost? The intellectual survival of anthropological theory, we argue, might well be connected to people's own resilience and bodily struggles for realities to come.},

"digital cultural objects add new operations that obliterate the conditions of the position of consumer.... Segments may easily be added or subtracted from the cultural object. Bits and pieces of any other cultural object may be inserted into or blended with the one in question. The cultural object loses thereby its fixity and the `consumer' becomes not a user but a creator. ... Digital objects, by contrast, are *inherently* open to transformation." ,<-- emphasis in original

we already know this in informatics, we already know about the power of standards to evince politics, but we have been absent from these conversations about politics, power, culture, and digital technologies

@article{Barley:1988,
	Annote = {Combination lit review and call for new directions in social studies of technology in organizations.

Two main theories in the space:

1. Sociology of Automation - History of studies in manufacturing - concerns of humans being replaced by technologies: "empty manual labor of meaning", "spawn an ever more alienated workforce" (p. 35) Late 60s - shift towards a stage theory: technology initially alienates, but later, with enough automation, technology actually led to a better, more optimistic future.

* Barley's critique: technologically deterministic

2. Deskilling Theory - Darker view of the impact of technology; grounds technology impact in the intent of designers \& context of social structures and organizations (esp. managerial decisions). {"Technologies} do not deskill simply because they constrain forms and relations of production, but because their constraints are intended" (p. 40).

* Barley's critique: socially deterministic; "concern for social construction ceases once the technology is deployed"

Barley's corrective:

Interpretive Materialism - Technical and social factors both inform the dynamics by which technologies occasion change. Barley departs from a focus on understanding the intentions in creating technologies, and shifts attention more to the way that meaning is generated through patterns of use. Focus on processes of adoption, appropriation \& use.

{"Neither} a purely materialistic nor a purely cultural theory of technology is adequate for mapping a technology's implications for the workplace, since both presume that the technology's meaning is fixed" (p. 52)

{"Interpretive} materialism initially points investigators to the particulars of the local context in which the technology is used" (p. 52)

Furthermore, rather than working within a "rhetoric of skill," researchers should broaden their focus (to what they're really interested in anyway), "the dynamics of power and influence" (p. 55), which Barley then translates into "a theory of technology's implications for a division of labor."

Barley then continues, on the basis of not that much research, to "postulate a number of contextual factors that should condition social action and thereby affect a technology's tendency to empower or degrade its users." (p. 56)

In three groups:

1. Technical Attributes

2. The organizational and occupational Milieu

3. The Socio-Economic Environment

Questions:

Some questions within each of these parts:

- Rational vs. ideological control - normative control is more empowering for workers? Is it not just (a possibly more insidious) form of control?  Foucault; governmentality?

- Like Zuboff, seems to implicitly rely on ideas of technological soothsaying, especially in the orgs section - that people with more power in design process, might be able to create technologies that in their deployment would then have a positive effect for those people... this falls back on the technological determinism argument a little bit.

Broader:

- Isn't Barley falling into a similar position as the deskilling theorists? Using Orlikowski's divisions from last week, that while they study how technologies "come to be" and thus neglect how they "come to be used," Barley studies the post-deployment, neglecting the pre-deployment? Can all this be captured in the organizational and occupational milieu, the socio-economic environment? Even when we talk about pre-deployment, it seems we often talk a lot about design as an ideal (and something that managers at a particular company would have control over), but not as much about the organizational politics of implementation - the "reality" of design and implementation is just as messy as adoption?

- Big claims based on admitedly lacking evidence. What is useful in creating such a detailed framework for study in advance? What are the risks involved in doing so?

- Again, the bounding issue - if we take up this framework, it's a lot to try to study (and there I was two questions ago, saying even this is not enough!) - are the bounds that Barley has drawn around contextual factors useful? Other boundaries?},

{\textgreater} e: what is the relationship between the category of 'local' and hte category of 'natural' and the category of 'infrastructure' - what can be 'infrastructural' - is that anything that provides context/background (figure v. ground?)

 

ch. 2: Postcolonial theory - does it even recognize 'information machines' and to what extent?

	Abstract = {This article synthesizes Spigel's research on the introduction of television and new technologies into the home. It looks at changing conceptions of media households' over the course of the last 50 years. The home theater' represents the media house of the 1950s; the mobile home' corresponds to the introduction of portable television in the 1960s; and the smart home' is the contemporary model of digital domesticity. The article considers how these changing models of home incorporate reigning middle class ideologies about family life for their respective times.},
	Annote = {reading notes 2011-07-08

this is a synthesis of spigel's work looking (mostly) at television in the home, though it touches on other technologies at the end.

focus on fantasies of the home, how the home is portrayed in advertisements for televisions, how television is portrayed, how gender roles are re-inscribed

in her words, 'how these changing modesl of home incorporate reigning middle class ideologies about family life for their respective times'

focus here on 'domesticity' and the metaphors and ways of imagining it as revealed through ads for televisions

[e: how are televisions assumed to be all about the home; domesticity; gender - she is coming to this with an argument of some kind in advance. televisions are not the topic of interest, they are a case for pursuing another topic of interest. this seems like the best way to use objects. not sure what it even means to think about theorizing objects themselves? maybe impossible]

1. 1950s, television as both an 'entertainment' and 'information' medium

- as a 'home theater' it transforms your home into a place where you can 'go' on a 'date' - it brings this world into your home

- as a 'window on the world' it transforms your home into a place around the world - it transports viewers

[e: two senses/directions of transportation: transporting the world to you; transporting you to the world]

some attention to anxieties here: isolation, confinement, (desire for husband's) attention - home theaters did not fully deliver on advertiser's promise that 'television would /negotiate/ the twin desires for participation in the public world and private family lifestyles'

[e: this is interesting, this coupling of twin desires, predating current technology. yay good example]

[e: also twin threads of television as dangerous (for children - addiction, violent rage) and safe (go to 'urban space' without leaving 'safe space of surburban home') - again another smartphone duality]

spigel: 'both utopian visions and middle-class anxieties about hte future of family life' - ref. self, 1992

1950s metaphor: 'domesticity \& domestic communications'

2. 1960s - home becomes a 'vehicle for transport' - ties in to space race stuff,

different set of anxieties about suburban home: suburbs as "unwelcoming, conformer-oriented, stressful places packed with tribes of neurotic housewives and beleaguered, unloved men" (390)

fantasies, here, turn to portable televisions, and imaginaries of 'leaving' the home (in contrast to fantasies of the home becoming the destination to stay in at)

in being portable, here, the television 'promsied to take the interior world outdoors' - tying in to raymond williams idea of 'mobile privatization - its promise to link te private family home with the modern industrial city' - this is the window on the world idea - with an inverted notion of 'privatized mobility' that 'is a mode of transport in and of itself that allowed people to take private life outdoors'

[e: this is about hte direction of public/private crossing/transferrence; what is getting transferred where, physically, and what does it bring with it, affectively]

ex. campsites on the floor, 'indoor-outdoor fantasy'

another theme that came with portable televisions is the idea of a 'lightweight companion'

'watching' tv becomes an 'active' and also 'non-domesticated' mode of experience

television came to be defined away from the family unit; people in public spaces with multiple others (often implied sexual partners), and people as individuals

remote control as an item of 'mastery' 'over space and women' 'and at the same time entirely sedentary' [e: another theme resonant with smartphones]

3. mobile homes -{\textgreater} smart homes

here we think about sentient spaces, that 'anticipate your needs'

[e: anticipation?]

'nostalgic appeals to domestic comfort and stability exist alongside a futuristic fantasy of liberation and escape'

market/political economy issues - home becomes a place of efficiency, 'make a valuable use of time'

[e: spigel seems not explicitly offended by the way that technology makes 'intimate' times useful times, talks about dream recording devices, receiving stock reports in the bathroom - but this is implicity. what is important about claims of technology use in traditionally intimate places/spaces/involved in intimate activities - are bedrooms and bathrooms the only intimate places? sleep? sex? shit?]

also in this section, noting nostalgia for nature, 'natural' - discusses gates' smarthome, 'in harmony with the land it sits on'

also nostalgia for ideals of domesticity - computers as the imaginary 1950s housewife

and technology and mastery/agency, servants/loyal companions.

technologies for 'conserving' 'rather than transforming' 'middle class values of family life and home'

super women - taking care of infants + make tele-deals

fantasy of escape

controlling home/caring for elderly parents/caring for children remotely, at a distance

[e: this last section is not as well-defined... seems all over the map. spigel summarizes as: ]

'this curious blend of baby boom nostalgia and 'gee whiz' futurism that runs through contemporary discourses on media homes is actually a disavowal of the present. nostalgia and futurism are both symptoms of a more prevailing anxiety and confusion about the contemporary world.'

overloaded statement about unpacking discourses around media in order to 'catch a glimpse of our ephemeral present'},

	Abstract = {Extending research into material, media, and cultural geographies of the home, our interest turns to the spatiotemporality of dwelling with information and communication technologies. We pose a number of questions: how do inhabitants and their media stuff adapt to the more rigid physical spaces of a building? How does the building respond to the more rapid changes to dwelling produced by this media stuff? And how are these differing times synchronised? In answer to these questions we present four case studies of homes in Melbourne, Australia, each representative of a particular strategy of synchronisation. They are: the found home, the imagined home, the designed home, and the renovated home. We identify logics informing these homes: the first naturalises the choices made, the second rationalises choices, and the third is one in which dwelling and (re)building are intertwined.},

@article{Agre:2002,
	Annote = {What is striking about the Internet is how much of this is happening at once, with no end in sight.

To understand these phenomena it helps to speak of institutions, which for present purposes are the persistent structures of interaction through which people organize their lives (Commons, 1970; Goodin, 1996; March and Olsen, 1989; North, 1990; Powell and DiMaggio, 1991)

Institutions exist in large part to solve informational problems--- negotiating identity, coordinating activity, managing risk, establish- ing divisions of intellectual labour, and discovering uses for things---and society is usefully understood as a tremendous sprawl of institutional arrangements, both designed and evolved, for managing the informational problems of a complicated way of life in a complicated world (Melody, 1987)

`The Internet' here is a synecdoche: a part that stands rhetorically for a larger whole.

The sociological point is that the Internet becomes deeply bound up in the speci{\'e}c arrangements by which people conduct their lives. In this sense and others, the Internet is embed- ded in a tremendous network of organized social relationships, and it is becoming more so every day.

Every important new technology creates an imaginative vacuum, and time and again this is the sort of thing that {\`e}ows into it: tropes of transcendental escape, utopian perfection, discontinuous change, communitarian intimacy, everlasting peace, and boundless prosperity.

A library is an institution, not just a technology

Thus the need for analysis: to locate the fault line that runs through the concept of a library, separating those features that comprise its technology-independent essence from those that do not.

An organized ensemble of relationships and roles is being renegotiated as stakeholders of every sort explore their options in the context of new technology.

The Internet is still something important: a general protocol for moving digital information from point A to point B. This protocol can be implemented on top of any type of hardware, and it can be used as a platform for the construction of a boundless variety of information services in turn.

it will be necessary to develop nontrivial ideas about institutions, technology, and the relations between them.},

	Abstract = {As humans we live and interact across a wildly diverse set of physical spaces. We each formulate our own personal meaning of place using a myriad of observable cues such as public-private, large-small, daytime-nighttime, loud-quiet, and crowded-empty. Not surprisingly, it is the people with which we share such spaces that dominate our perception of place. Sometimes these people are friends, family and colleagues. More often, and particularly in public urban spaces we inhabit, the individuals who affect us are ones that we repeatedly observe and yet do not directly interact with - our Familiar Strangers. This paper explores our often ignored yet real relationships with Familiar Strangers. We describe several experiments and studies that led to designs for both a personal, body-worn, wireless device and a mobile phone based application that extend the Familiar Stranger relationship while respecting the delicate, yet important, constraints of our feelings and affinities with strangers in pubic places.},

	Abstract = {One defining quality of our current moment is its characteristic state of anticipation, of thinking and living toward the future. Anticipation has epistemic value, a virtue emerging through actuarial saturation as sciences of the actual are displaced by speculative forecast. It is a politics of temporality and affect. Key dimensions are: injunction as the moral imperative to characterize and inhabit states of uncertainty; abduction as requisite tacking back and forth between futures, pasts and presents, framing templates for producing the future; optimization as the moral responsibility of citizens to secure their `best possible futures'; preparedness as living in `preparation for' potential trauma; and possibility as `ratcheting up' hopefulness, especially through technoscience. Anticipation is the palpable sense that things could be (all) right if we leverage new spaces of opportunity, reconfiguring `the possible.' We illustrate exemplary sites of anticipatory practice, especially biomedical, highlighting how such sites are gendered, increasingly implicating young girls. {[ABSTRACT} {FROM} {AUTHOR]}},

@article{Tutton:2011,
	Abstract = {A number of science and technology studies {(STS)} scholars have suggested that the performativity of the `forward-looking statement' is an important institutional element of contemporary biocapital. This paper considers how, when making projections that set up expectations about their futures, firms also acknowledge and detail the risk factors that they face in their operations. In other words, in addition to projecting optimistic scenarios, firms advance much more pessimistic images of futures that they wish to avoid: possible failures, disappointments and financial losses. I examine such pessimistic projections in company filings to the {US} Securities and Exchange Commission {(SEC)} and investigate their discursive character. I ask what value such pessimism might hold for {STS} scholars interested in the mangle of science and capital. I sample the {SEC} filings of three companies: {deCODE} Genetics, {DNAPrint} Genomics Inc. and {NitroMed} Inc. In their own particular ways, these projections exemplify the volatility and the promise of the life sciences in the 21st century. My reading shows that such pessimistic risk factor statements provide interesting commentary on the dynamics of risk and innovation in the context of contemporary biocapital, raising questions to which analysts to date have given little attention.},

@article{Marcus:2006,
	Abstract = {This article shows how, in recent works of cultural analysis, the concept of `assemblage' has been been derived from key sources of theory and put to work to provide a structure-like surrogate to express certain prominent values of a modernist sensibility in the discourse of description and analysis. Assemblage is a sort of anti-structural concept that permits the researcher to speak of emergence, heterogeneity, the decentred and the ephemeral in nonetheless ordered social life. There are other related concepts, like collage, which have been used to give these values substance in research, but currently assemblage is enjoying a popularity perhaps because of the continuing fascination of the work of Deleuze and Guattari.},

@article{Spigel:2005,
	Abstract = {This article analyzes recent architectural and product designs for computerized smart homes. The smart home is a sentient space where human subjects and domestic objects speak to one another via intelligent agents and internet connections. This article explores the industrial logic behind this new vision of home (i.e. the links between the hi-tech industry and the building/home appliance industries) and examines the mode of subjectivity the smart home demands. It calls this mode of subjectivity 'posthuman domesticity' (a term to explore the way that everyday human experience is orchestrated by telerobotics and intelligent agents). Analyzing architectural designs, advertisements and magazines, the article focuses on how the smart home industry promotes an ideal of 'conspicuous production' in which the luxury home is no longer just a site of leisure and consumption, but also the ultimate workplace. It argues that smart homes reconfigure but also reinforce gendered patterns of domestic labor and leisure.},
	Annote = {Data sources:

    trade magazines - broadband house, digital home: opening editorial, cover illustrations,
    roll-oh commercial
    corporate research labs & their websites: e.g. panasonic-center.com
    architectural designs

connections to other research

    interview-based research by other people (p. 419-420)
    census & pew statistics (p. 414-416)
    MIT's house_n
    architectural plans (e.g. hariri & hariri - hosue that "reflects [the] changing configuration of family, work, play, communication and virutal and actual reality" p. 414)

connections to theory

    echaverria (??)
    home/work - nippert-eng
    gender roles, domesticity - harraway
    raymond williams -  smart home allows personal privacy while providing mobility required by industrailization (p. 413)

spigel's theory?

    conspicuous production & "performative communication" -- "it has become a sign of /status/ to seem perpetually occupied and 'in touch' with anonymous others -- and importantly, often we do not know whether someone is phoning home or phoning the office...performative communication allows people to demonstrate their labor value as social actors in a networked world...we need an audience in physical space for our communciative acts in cyberspace" (p. 416)
        e: do we?
    technologies thus far are not taking us into the kind of posthuman futures imagined by e.g. harraway, instead, they replicate old ideals and cultural models -- ends with: "if we do not imagine the future, then panasonic, ibm and microsoft most certainly will" (p. 422) -- who will if we dont? who are we? who am III OMG.
    "on the one hand, a number of architects and engineers are creating pro-social technological and design solutions to human concerns such as medical care, children's education and issues of isolation and dependency that effect the eoderly. on the other hand, smart homes are an industry and as such they are targeted at the lifestyles and presumed aspiration sof the consumers who can afford them" (p. 421)
    what ideals are current technologies replicating -- how do we craft visions of technologies as simultaneously new and interesting, but also non-disruptive? i think this is why advertising is an interesting space to investigate

questions:

    how and when do people create boundaries?
        as this becomes increasingly a non-technical issue, e.g. at&t extends mobil coverage through home internet
    home as a workplace for
        people who "bring work home"
        people who "work from home" / telecommute
        differences etsy moms, stock traders, tech professionals, lawyers, doctors, ...who else?
        why do we not talk about agricultral employment when we talk about people working at home (p. 416)
    "smart home offers a curious inversion of the relations between people and their things. intelligent agents become more lifelike...while humans become more 'thing-like'" (p. 409)
    "home...mutate[s] into a commodified sphere of communciation" (p. 412)
    how have the stories told by, e.g. 1996 cover of wired magazine (p. 416) changed
        from: "advertisers do not merely promise leisure through the puchase of household applicances (as they had since the 1920s), they also offer potential consumers the dream of super-productivity -- and at no personal sacrifice to love, happiness, health, leisure and child-rearing" (p. 416)
        to: msft wm7 commercial?

inspirations for questions to ask

    what is being produced by researchers in this space? (this is another angle i hadn't given a lot of attention to)
    what is being sold today?
    how is it sold?
        what is pictured as new/different - what makes the purchase worthy?
        how is the item shown as already fitting in?
        what problem/need does it solve/address?
        what new ability does it grant?
        what is it? (portrayed as (for))
        what features are important?
        who is suppposed to use it?
        are there people: present/mediated? who are they? what are they doing?

In order to create more successful technologies for the creative laboratory setting, we need a deeper understanding of the values of the researchers we are designing for and the unique roles of technology in the research laboratory. Our three-year ethnographic study of a biomedical engineering {(BME)} lab contributes to building this foundation for future design. Drawing form a distributed and situated cognition framework, our analysis highlights the ways in which technology is integrated into the researchers' daily practices. This study is one of the first deep ethnographies of a laboratory culture with a central focus on technology and provides several insights for the design community.},

@article{Markus:1988,
	Abstract = {This article concerns theories about why and how information technology affects organizational life. Good theory guides research, which, when applied, increases the likelihood that information technology will be employed with desirable consequences for users, organizations, and other interested parties. But what is a good theory? Theories are often evaluated in terms of their content--the specific concepts used and the human values served. This article examines theories in terms of their structures--theorists' assumptions about the nature and direction of causal influence. Three dimensions of causal structure are considered--causal agency, logical structure, and level of analysis. Causal agency refers to beliefs about the nature of causality: whether external forces cause change, whether people act purposefully to accomplish intended objectives, or whether changes emerge unpredictably from the interaction of people and events. Logical structure refers to the temporal aspect of theory--static versus dynamic--and to the logical relationships between the "causes" and the outcomes. Level of analysis refers to the entities about which the theory poses concepts and relationships--individuals, groups, organizations, and society. While there are many possible structures for good theory about the role of information technology in organizational change, only a few of these structures can be seen in current theorizing. Increased awareness of the options, open discussion of their advantages and disadvantages, and explicit characterization of future theoretical statements in terms of the dimensions and categories discussed here should, we believe, promote the development of better theory.},

	Abstract = {This article examines the relationship between the use of computer-based systems and
transformations in parts of the social order. Answers to this question rest heavily on the
way computer-based systems are consumed -not just produced or dissemtnated. The
discourse about computerezation advanced in many professional magazines and the mass
media is saturated with talk about "revolution, " and yet substantial social changes are
often difficult to cdentcfy in carefully designed empirical studies. The article examines
qualitative case studies of computerization in welfare agencies, urban planning, accounting, marketing, and manufacturing to examine the ways that computerization alters
social life in varced ways: sometemes restructuring relationships and in other cases
reinforcing existing social relationships. The article also examines some of the theoret
ical issues in studies of computerization, such as drawing boundaries. It concludes with
some observations about the sociology of computer sctence as an academic discipline.},

@article{Barley:1986,
	Abstract = {New medical imaging devices, such as the {CT} scanner, have begun to challenge traditional role relations among radiologists and radiological technologists. Under some conditions, these technologies may actually alter the organizational and occupational structure of radiological work. However, current theories of technology and organizational form are insensitive to the potential number of structural variations implicit in role-based change. This paper expands recent sociological thought on the link between institution and action to outline a theory of how technology might occasion different organizational structures by altering institutionalized roles and patterns of interaction. In so doing, technology is treated as a social rather than a physical object, and structure is conceptualized as a process rather than an entity. The implications of the theory are illustrated by showing how identical {CT} scanners occasioned similar structuring processes in two radiology departments and yet led to divergent forms of organization. The data suggest that to understand how technologies alter organizational structures researchers may need to integrate the study of social action and the study of social form.},

@article{Orlikowski:1992,
	Abstract = {This paper develops a new theoretical model with which to examine the interaction between technology and organizations. Early research studies assumed technology to be an objective, external force that would have deterministic impacts on organizational properties such as structure. Later researchers focused on the human aspect of technology, seeing it as the outcome of strategic choice and social action. This paper suggests that either view is incomplete, and proposes a reconceptualization of technology that takes both perspectives into account. A theoretical model--the structurational model of technology--is built on the basis of this new conceptualization, and its workings explored through discussion of a field study of information technology. The paper suggests that the reformulation of the technology concept and the structurational model of technology allow a deeper and more dialectical understanding of the interaction between technology and organizations. This understanding provides insight into the limits and opportunities of human choice, technology development and use, and organizational design. Implications for future research of the new concept of technology and the structurational model of technology are discussed.},

@article{Fraser:1990,
	Annote = {Fraser - Rethinking the public sphere

the private sphere influences the public; no a priori boundaries

Fraser takes as given that the idea of the public sphere is crucial to understanding current democracy and also for "theorizing the limits" [of it].

other people have been using the idea of 'the public sphere' - or the expression anyway - in conflated ways, is it about the 'state' or 'public discourse' or economic markets?

-- for habermas: it is public discourse, distinctly separate from both the state and markets

fraser will conclude, though, that a reconceptualization of the public sphere to entangle discourse with both the state and markets is necessary

she outlines habermas's perspective of the public sphere as:

- the mechanism to hold the state accountable, requiring:

1. information about the state being accessible to the public -{\textgreater} leading to the formation of public opinion

2. legal guarantee/mechanism for the transferrance of public opinion -{\textgreater} (re)formation of the state

[e: this general idea is quite pervasive today, and often with the idea that simply providing 1.a. will/should lead to reformation -- see, e.g. disappointments in media, sunlight foundation, calls for open government]

habermas notes that the public sphere was never/is not fully recognized in its full "utopian potential" because:

1. open access never happened

2. clear separation of state and market economy not possible; private interests not excluded fully from public sphere [this point is unclear]

3. public fragmented - "competing private interests replaced public reasoned public debate" - backroom deals, etc. class stratification \& struggle

4. 'critical scrutiny gave way to public relations' etc.

she critiques habermas on four points, saying he idealized the public sphere in a way that makes it not a useful tool to think with/change society/etc.

1. fraser argues that social equality is necessary in order to have open access and 'participatory parity' -- i.e. political democrazy cannot exist without equality

2. we need multiple (counter) publics. even in a case where equality exists, we still need a multiplicity of publics. debate/deliberation can be a way of masking domination

3. private issues need to be a part of the public sphere because (1) change, (2) issues can't be determined as 'public' in any apriori way, only through debate does an issue become public

4. functioning public sphere cannot be sharply distinguished from the state and the economy. weak public spheres: what habermas describes, those that can only form opinions; strong spheres: integrated in government in some way - have the power to do more than just form an opinion but act on it/make a decision

calls for a new public sphere, doesn't really define one here.

 

other questions/concerns:

- public/private distinction. reconsidering this, what does it mean; these are culturally constructed labels and rhetorical moves; privacy used in order to dominate; make issues unimportant; push issues out of spotlight; make sure the issues are unheard \& thus that they do not change.

[e: how is privacy used w.r.t. technology? w.r.t. technological problems? w.r.t. 'domestic' matters? w.r.t. work/life balance? w.r.t. ??]

- uses examples of domestic violence, workplace democracy --{\textgreater} making things 'everyone's problem vs. 'private'/'personal' problem is important for change in her view

[e: not sure about this? change requires public consensus? still not totally sold on democracy?]},

-- attenuated:

{\textgreater} "masks the wide variety of processes and procedures involved historically in the administration of law and of bodies"

2.

obesity, in particular, ties in to this debate because

1. it is not something that people have direct total control over - this is the obvious sociological argument of social position, class, social infrastructure, etc.

2. it is, in a way, something that prevents people from being good workers; it is a financial drain on society (insurance-wise)

3. it is moralized as an individual problem

 

smartphone 'addiction'/smartphones as a problem

1. not something that people have ontrol over

2. this is interesting - it is caught here between being something that is useful for markets (the always-on/always-available/more efficient worker) but is also being framed as potentially bad for business (you need 'happy worker bees')

3. it is moralized as an individual problem

	Abstract = {As a way of tracking popular framing of {CMC}, this article critically reviews an international corpus of 101 print-media accounts (from 2001 to 2005) of language-use in technologies such as instant messaging and text messaging. From the combined perspective of folk linguistics and critical discourse analysis, this type of metadiscourse (i.e., discourse about discourse) reveals the conceptual and ideological assumptions by which particular communication practices come to be institutionalized and understood. The article is illustrated with multiple examples from across the corpus in order to demonstrate the most recurrent metadiscursive themes in mediatized depictions of technologically or computer-mediated discourse {(CMD).} Rooted in extravagant characterizations of the prevalence and impact of {CMD}, together with highly caricatured exemplifications of actual practice, these popular but influential (mis)representations typically exaggerate the difference between {CMD} and nonmediated discourse, misconstrue the ``evolutionary'' trajectory of language change, and belie the cultural embeddedness of {CMD.}},

The mobile phone is used for real time coordination while on the run, adolescents use it to manage their freedom, and teens text to each other day and night. The mobile phone is more than a simple technical innovation or social fad, more than just an intrusion on polite society. This book, based on world-wide research involving tens of thousands of interviews and contextual observations, looks into the impact of the phone on our daily lives. The mobile phone has fundamentally affected our accessibility, safety and security, coordination of social and business activities, and use of public places. Based on research conducted in dozens of countries, this insightful and entertaining book examines the once unexpected interaction between humans and cell phones, and between humans, period. The compelling discussion and projections about the future of the telephone should give designers everywhere a more informed practice and process, and provide researchers with new ideas to last {years.*Rich} Ling (an American working in Norway) is a prominent researcher, interviewed in the new technology article in the November 9 issue of the New York Times Magazine. {*A} particularly "good read", this book will be important to the designers, information designers, social psychologists, and others who will have an impact on the development of the new third generation of mobile telephones. {*Carefully} and wittily written by a senior research scientist at Telenor, Norway's largest telecommunications company, and developer of the first mobile telephone system that allowed for international roaming.},

It addresses a fundamental question of our time: is contemporary society significantly different from the society that formed the theories and basic concepts of the founders of sociology? {"The} Virtual Self" addresses major issues in sociology that inform virtually all of a student's course work. Of central concern is the relationship between everyday life and social structure in key domains of communication, personality, work/family, leisure and entertainment, and economics. At the same time, the book advances an argument about our stage of civilization, joining dialogue with critical thinkers and theorists who bemoan the loss of community and civic discourse. These perspectives from critical theory and postmodernism are introduced in readable, digestible ways as discussions are linked to standard sociological concerns such as the relationship between self and {society.Written} in a lively, accessible style, {"The} Virtual Self" presumes no sociological background and cites ample literature for further reference. Students and scholars will find it an engaging and exciting text.},

@book{Urry:2000,

If sociology is to make a pertinent contribution to the post societal era it must forget the social rigidities of the pre-global order and, instead, switch its focus to the study of both physical and virtual movement. In considering this sociology of mobilities, the book concerns itself with the travels of people, ideas, images, messages, waste products and money across international borders, and the implications these mobilities have to our experiences of time, space, dwelling and citizenship.  Sociology Beyond Society extends recent debate about globalisation both by providing an analysis of how mobilities reconstitute social life in uneven and complex ways, and by arguing for the significance of objects, senses, and time and space in the theorising of contemporary life.  This book will be essential reading for undergraduates and graduates studying sociology and cultural geography.},

Contrary to the apparent enlivening of objects promised by the sciences of the artificial, the author proposes that the rhetorics and practices of those sciences work to obscure the performative nature of both persons and things. The question then shifts from debates over the status of human-like machines, to that of how humans and machines are enacted as similar or different in practice, and with what theoretical, practical and political consequences. Drawing on recent scholarship across the social sciences, humanities and computing, the author argues for research aimed at tracing the differences within specific sociomaterial arrangements without resorting to essentialist divides. This requires expanding our unit of analysis, while recognizing the inevitable cuts or boundaries through which technological systems are constituted.},

@book{Barad:2007,
	Abstract = {Meeting the Universe Halfway is an ambitious book with far-reaching implications for numerous fields in the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. In this volume, Karen Barad, theoretical physicist and feminist theorist, elaborates her theory of agential realism. Offering an account of the world as a whole rather than as composed of separate natural and social realms, agential realism is at once a new epistemology, ontology, and ethics. The starting point for Barad's analysis is the philosophical framework of quantum physicist Niels Bohr. Barad extends and partially revises Bohr's philosophical views in light of current scholarship in physics, science studies, and the philosophy of science as well as feminist, poststructuralist, and other critical social theories. In the process, she significantly reworks understandings of space, time, matter, causality, agency, subjectivity, and {objectivity.In} an agential realist account, the world is made of entanglements of ``social'' and ``natural'' agencies, where the distinction between the two emerges out of specific intra-actions. Intra-activity is an inexhaustible dynamism that configures and reconfigures relations of space-time-matter. In explaining intra-activity, Barad reveals questions about how nature and culture interact and change over time to be fundamentally misguided. And she reframes understanding of the nature of scientific and political practices and their ``interrelationship.'' Thus she pays particular attention to the responsible practice of science, and she emphasizes changes in the understanding of political practices, critically reworking Judith Butler's influential theory of performativity. Finally, Barad uses agential realism to produce a new interpretation of quantum physics, demonstrating that agential realism is more than a means of reflecting on science; it can be used to actually do science.},

@book{Butler:1993,
	Abstract = {In Bodies That Matter, Judith Butler further develops her distinctive theory of gender by examining the workings of power at the most "material" dimensions of sex and sexuality. Deepening the inquiries she began in Gender Trouble, Butler offers an original reformulation of the materiality of bodies, examining how the power of heterosexual hegemony forms the "matter" of bodies, sex, and gender.  Butler argues that power operates to constrain "sex" from the start, delimiting what counts as a viable sex. Conceived as a regulatory norm, "sex" is appropriated through a citational set of practices. When identifications undercut the heterosexual imperative, abjected beings are produced who become the occasions for a critical rearticulation of heterosexual hegemony.  Butler offers a clarification of the notion of "performativity" introduced in Gender Trouble and explores the meaning of a citational politics. The text includes readings of Plato, Irigaray, Lacan, and Freud on the formation of materiality and bodily boundaries; {"Paris} is Burning," Nella Larsen's {"Passing}," and short stories by Willa Cather; along with a reconsideration of "performativity" and politics in feminist, queer, and radical democratic theory.  Developing more gender trouble across a variety of philosophical, psychoanalytic, and fictional works, Bodies That Matter opens new questions in feminism, poststructuralism, and queer theory.},

Claude Fischer presents the first social history of this vital but little-studied technology--how we encountered, tested, and ultimately embraced it with enthusiasm. Using telephone ads, oral histories, telephone industry correspondence, and statistical data, Fischer's work is a colorful exploration of how, when, and why Americans started communicating in this radically new {manner.Studying} three California communities, Fischer uncovers how the telephone became integrated into the private worlds and community activities of average Americans in the first decades of this century. Women were especially avid in their use, a phenomenon which the industry first vigorously discouraged and then later wholeheartedly promoted. Again and again Fischer finds that the telephone supported a wide-ranging network of social relations and played a crucial role in community life, especially for women, from organizing children's relationships and church activities to alleviating the loneliness and boredom of rural {life.Deftly} written and meticulously researched, America Calling adds an important new chapter to the social history of our nation and illuminates a fundamental aspect of cultural modernism that is integral to contemporary life.},

	Abstract = {Data on 43 industrial organizations point to the existence of relationships between an organization's technology and aspects of its internal structure, including the number of specialized sub-units, the number of levels of authority, the ratio of managers and supervisors to total personnel, and the degree of program specification within the organization. A primary finding is that the less changeful an organization's technology, the more likely the foregoing aspects of structure are to increase. The findings hold with size and a number of other organizational variables controlled. The importance of considering technology in the comparative analysis of formal organizations is emphasized. It is also suggested that the technology variable, in connection with other aspects of organizational structure, serves to establish a rudimentary typology of sociotechnical organization and that the use of the typology may provide a useful analytic tool for the investigation of a number of organizational processes, including those of decision-making and patterns of intra-organizational conflict.},

	Abstract = {Using data from a study of 110 New Jersey manufacturing concerns, relationships are examined between plant technology and four dimensions of internal structure: differentiation, the size of various personnel components, supervisory spans of control, and decentralization of decision-making authority. For linear associations, Woodward's notion of a broad "technological imperative" is rejected, and the analysis verifies the general findings of the Aston studies. However, the Aston group's hypothesis of an interaction effect between size, production technology, and administrative structure is not supported, while strong curvilinear relationships, independent of size, are observed between production process type and many of the structural measures. Automation of administrative support functions through the use of computers exerts numerous influences on the organization of work which parallel those of highly mechanized "process" technologies, and it is postulated that these trends will continue with increasing automation of the manufacturing operation itself.},

	Abstract = {Despite evidence of a positive relationship between information technology {(IT)} investments and firm performance, results still vary across firms and performance measures. We explore two organizational explanations for this variation: differences in firms' {IT} investment allocations and their {IT} capabilities. We develop a theoretical model of {IT} resources, defined as the combination of specific {IT} assets and organizational {IT} capabilities. We argue that investments into different {IT} assets are guided by firms' strategies (e.g., cost leadership or innovation) and deliver value along performance dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. We hypothesize that firms derive additional value per {IT} dollar through a mutually reinforcing system of organizational {IT} capabilities built on complementary practices and competencies. Empirically, we test the impact of {IT} assets, {IT} capabilities, and their combination on four dimensions of firm performance: market valuation, profitability, cost, and innovation. Our results---based on data on {IT} investment allocations and {IT} capabilities in 147 {U.S.} firms from 1999 to 2002---demonstrate that {IT} investment allocations and organizational {IT} capabilities drive differences in firm performance. Firms' total {IT} investment is not associated with performance, but investments in specific {IT} assets explain performance differences along dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. In addition, a system of organizational {IT} capabilities strengthens the performance effects of {IT} assets and broadens their impact beyond their intended purpose. The results help explain variance in returns to {IT} capital across firms and expand our understanding of alignment between {IT} and organizations. We illustrate our findings with examples from a case study of 7-Eleven Japan.},

@article{Trevino:2000,
	Abstract = {Theorizing about communication media attitudes and behaviors has drawn upon multiple theories (e.g., media richness, social influence). But these theories have often been pitted against each other rather than considered as complementary in more comprehensive studies. Furthermore, previous research has tended to focus more on newer communication media such as electronic mail rather than more traditional media. Finally, communication media research has studied attitudes toward media, use of media, and only occasionally media choice. Yet, all three dependent variables are {important.This} comprehensive survey hypothesized and tested multiple influences (based on multiple theories) in a study of media attitudes and behaviors. The media included electronic mail, fax, letters, and face-to-face meetings. The outcomes included media choice (an individual's decision to use a medium in a particular communication incident), media use (an individual's general pattern of use over time), and media attitudes (an individual's general subjective evaluation of {media).Results} suggested that a number of factors differentiated among media choices, including medium symbolism, message equivocality, distance between message partners, perceived media richness, number of message recipients, and perceived message recipients' attitudes. General attitudes toward the different media were influenced most consistently by perceived medium richness. New media attitudes were also influenced by person/technology interaction factors. General medium use was influenced by different factors for the different {media.The} results generally supported a comprehensive theoretical approach to understanding media attitudes and behaviors. All of the theories have some merit in explaining media attitudes and behaviors. But different factors, derived from different theories, were more important in accounting for each of the dependent variables'media choices, attitudes, and use. We hope that this investigation will help research in this area move toward the development of more integrative theoretical models.},

	Abstract = {Western philosophy has long been divided between empiricists, who argue that human understanding has its basis in experience, and rationalists, who argue that reason is the source of knowledge. A central issue in the debate is the nature of concepts, the internal representations we use to think about the world. The traditional empiricist thesis that concepts are built up from sensory input has fallen out of favor. Mainstream cognitive science tends to echo the rationalist tradition, with its emphasis on innateness. In Furnishing the Mind, Jesse Prinz attempts to swing the pendulum back toward {empiricism.Prinz} provides a critical survey of leading theories of concepts, including imagism, definitionism, prototype theory, exemplar theory, the theory theory, and informational atomism. He sets forth a new defense of concept empiricism that draws on philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology and introduces a new version of concept empiricism called proxytype theory. He also provides accounts of abstract concepts, intentionality, narrow content, and concept combination. In an extended discussion of innateness, he covers Noam Chomsky's arguments for the innateness of grammar, developmental psychologists' arguments for innate cognitive domains, and Jerry Fodor's argument for radical concept nativism.},

	Abstract = {According to the Conceptual Act Theory of Emotion, the situated conceptualization used to construe a situation determines the emotion experienced. A neuroimaging experiment tested two core hypotheses of this theory: (1) different situated conceptualizations produce different forms of the same emotion in different situations, (2) the composition of a situated conceptualization emerges from shared multimodal circuitry distributed across the brain that produces emotional states generally. To test these hypotheses, the situation in which participants experienced an emotion was manipulated. On each trial, participants immersed themselves in a physical danger or social evaluation situation and then experienced fear or anger. According to Hypothesis 1, the brain activations for the same emotion should differ as a function of the preceding situation (after removing activations that arose while constructing the situation). According to Hypothesis 2, the critical activations should reflect conceptual processing relevant to the emotion in the current situation, drawn from shared multimodal circuitry underlying emotion. The results supported these predictions and demonstrated the compositional process that produces situated conceptualizations dynamically.},

@book{Bennett:2009,
	Abstract = {In Vibrant Matter the political theorist Jane Bennett, renowned for her work on nature, ethics, and affect, shifts her focus from the human experience of things to things themselves. Bennett argues that political theory needs to do a better job of recognizing the active participation of nonhuman forces in events. Toward that end, she theorizes a ``vital materiality'' that runs through and across bodies, both human and nonhuman. Bennett explores how political analyses of public events might change were we to acknowledge that agency always emerges as the effect of ad hoc configurations of human and nonhuman forces. She suggests that recognizing that agency is distributed this way, and is not solely the province of humans, might spur the cultivation of a more responsible, ecologically sound politics: a politics less devoted to blaming and condemning individuals than to discerning the web of forces affecting situations and {events.Bennett} examines the political and theoretical implications of vital materialism through extended discussions of commonplace things and physical phenomena including stem cells, fish oils, electricity, metal, and trash. She reflects on the vital power of material formations such as landfills, which generate lively streams of chemicals, and omega-3 fatty acids, which can transform brain chemistry and mood. Along the way, she engages with the concepts and claims of Spinoza, Nietzsche, Thoreau, Darwin, Adorno, and Deleuze, disclosing a long history of thinking about vibrant matter in Western philosophy, including attempts by Kant, Bergson, and the embryologist Hans Driesch to name the ``vital force'' inherent in material forms. Bennett concludes by sketching the contours of a ``green materialist'' ecophilosophy.},

Combining a richness of ethnographic detail with a challenging and innovative theoretical analysis, Daniel argues that symbolic anthropologists have yet to appreciate the multifaceted function of the sign and its role in the creation of culture. This provocative study underscores the need for Western intellectual traditions in general and anthropology in particular to deepen its discourse with South Asian cultural and religious thought.},

	Abstract = {Nearly half (46\%) of American adults are smartphone owners as of February 2012, an increase of 11 percentage points over the 35\% of Americans who owned a smartphone last May. Two in five adults (41\%) own a cell phone that is not a smartphone, meaning that smartphone owners are now more prevalent within the overall population than owners of more basic mobile phones.

Nearly every major demographic group---men and women, younger and middle-aged adults, urban and rural residents, the wealthy and the less well-off---experienced a notable uptick in smartphone penetration over the last year. Overall adoption levels are at 60\% or more within several cohorts, such as college graduates, 18-35 year olds and those with an annual household income of \$75,000 or more.

Although this overall increase in smartphone ownership is relatively widespread, several groups saw modest or non-existent growth in the last year. Chief among these are seniors, as just 13\% of those ages 65 and older now own a smartphone.},

@article{Wajcman:2008,
	Abstract = {Assumptions about the pace of life speeding up abound in contemporary social theory. While many factors are contributing to this phenomenon, information and communication technologies are seen as the main drivers. This article considers the way social theorists analyse the concepts of time and speed and then examines how these claims might be assessed in the light of empirical research. Such research shows that time compression has multiple dimensions, and that the effect of digital devices like the mobile phone is not simply one of acceleration. In particular, I suggest that the social studies of technology offers a richer analysis of the reciprocal relationship between technological innovation and changing time practices. My argument is that while the hitherto neglected temporal dimension in sociological theory is now being addressed, there is an urgent need for increased dialogue to connect social theory with detailed empirical studies. Without this, we will continue to have difficulty distinguishing social science from science fiction.},

When Susan Maushart first announced her intention to pull the plug on her family's entire armory of electronic weaponry for six months-from the itsy-bitsiest {iPod} Shuffle to her son's seriously souped-up gaming {PC-her} three kids didn't blink an eye.

For any parent who's ever {IM-ed} their child to the dinner table, this account of one family's self-imposed exile from the Information Age will leave you {LOLing} with recognition. But it will also make you think.  The Winter of Our Disconnect challenges readers to examine the toll that technology is taking on their own family connections, and to create a media ecology that instead encourages kids-and parents-to thrive. Indeed, as a self-confessed single mom who "slept with her {iPhone}," Maushart knew her family's exile from Cyburbia wasn't going to be any easier for her than for her three teenagers, ages fourteen, fifteen, and eighteen. Yet they all soon discovered that the rewards of becoming "unplugged" were more rich and varied than any cyber reality could ever be.},

I will demonstrate that while materiality is an integral aspect of organisational activity, it has either been ignored by management research or investigated through an ontology of separateness that cannot account for the multiple and dynamic ways in which the social and the material are constitutively entangled in everyday life. I will end by pointing to some possible alternative perspectives that may have the potential to help management scholars take seriously the distributed and complex sociomaterial configurations that form and perform contemporary organisations.},
